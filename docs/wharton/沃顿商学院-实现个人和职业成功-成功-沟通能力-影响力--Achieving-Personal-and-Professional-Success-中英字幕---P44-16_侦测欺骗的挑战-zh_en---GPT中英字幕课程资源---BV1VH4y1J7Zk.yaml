- en: Detecting deception poses a real challenge。 It's a challenge because we're mostly
    not very good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at detecting lies。 We start off with a very trusting stance。 Most people believe
    what we're told。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is functional。 That is， we need to gather a lot of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from other people and we're going to ask questions。 We're going to listen to
    what people are saying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in the main， it's going to be truthful， useful information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we start off with a stance where we're open， receptive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and trusting of most of the information we get。 So that's the first idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so when deceptive information flows in， we typically incorporate it as true。
    Second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we tend to be overconfident in our ability， to detect deception。 So that is，
    we think that， oh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if somebody were lying to us， we would know。 I'd know if my kids were lying
    to me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd know if my spouse were lying to me。 I'd know if my coworkers were lying
    to me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the assumption that we have。 And we know from a lot of evidence it's
    just not true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not true in experimental studies that have looked at this。 And it's not
    true empirically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know that there are many spouses who have been misled， and never learned
    about that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's also particularly true this overconfidence， of professionals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So maybe police officers or judges， believe they're going to be better at lie
    detection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than they really are。 And relational partners are particularly overconfident。
    So in light of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what can we do？ Now it turns out that there are cues， but that most of them
    are subtle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're so subtle that we often fail to appreciate it。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can look at faces of people， who are smiling。 And I can ask you， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who's authentically smiling， who's really happy， who's pretending to be happy？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it turns out that there are important differences。 And we can guide our
    focus and attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to those differences， but we don't naturally go there。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of these smiles here is fake。 One of them is real， or what's called a Duchenne
    smile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what's the difference？ Well， it turns out the difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that the real smile has not just the smile in the mouth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also has crow's feet around the eyes。 That is， we're essentially smiling
    with our eyes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what makes an authentic smile different from a fake smile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6e0059c9d550cfb34a43ddc35a7c049b_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So one question we have is where we should direct our focus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one idea is we can think about the content of the message。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So is there something that didn't make sense， or wasn't consistent？ Was something
    odd or unusual？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that should cause us to probe further， to investigate something more carefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also look at how a message gets delivered。 What are the nonverbal cues
    around it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When and where is something getting said？ And then we can think about the match
    between the content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the delivery。 So does this message make sense in how it's delivered？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I'm saying something is important， am I acting as if it's important？ And
    if there's a mismatch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it should also， cause us to probe further。 This is related to the idea of detecting
    deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: versus suspicion。 The idea here is that we'll often feel suspicious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be some non-conscious cue， some very subtle cue， we might have picked
    up on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we're not sure about。 And the idea is that when we feel suspicious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it should cause us to probe more deeply。 To collect additional information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we should seek information from other sources， that is we should be paying attention
    to how suspicious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we might feel。 It's very difficult to ascertain deception， based on some cues
    we've detected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6e0059c9d550cfb34a43ddc35a7c049b_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And instead， my argument is that we， should feel a sense or gauge our sense
    of suspicion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we feel suspicious， that's caused to dig deeper， probe further。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and investigate something more carefully。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
