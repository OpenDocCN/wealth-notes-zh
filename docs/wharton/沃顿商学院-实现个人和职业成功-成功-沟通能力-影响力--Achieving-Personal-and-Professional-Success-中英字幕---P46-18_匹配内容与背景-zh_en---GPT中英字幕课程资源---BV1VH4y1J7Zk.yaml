- en: place for us to look for deception。 So we talked a little bit about this idea
    of synchrony and asynchrony。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So does the text and the nonverbal cues around that text， do they match， they
    correspond。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or are they different？ So sometimes they're incongruous。 So somebody will say
    no。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but nod their head yes。 Or they'll catch themselves and correct themselves midway
    through。 Like no。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean yes。 That catch and correct is sometimes a really important cue to detect
    deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mentioned polygraph tests before。 They're polygraphers that will do things
    like ask somebody a question and if they catch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: somebody doing this， sort of catch and correct。 Like no， I mean yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They'll shut down the polygraph and say， I know you did it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is they'll be so certain that these cues are diagnostic that they'll know
    exactly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's happened。 Sometimes there's this delay。 So this delay that I mentioned
    before that I'll say I didn't do it and then negative head。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: swing follows that。 But as we sometimes will say things and then follow that
    later with the nonverbal cues and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of that asynchrony should really tip us off that there's something not quite
    right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when the emotions don't match， the behaviors don't match， we're learning
    something important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we should dig deeper into that issue。 So there are often cases like somebody
    reports a kidnapping。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they wait to report it or， sometimes they'll cross county lines and report
    it in a different county。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to think about why would you do that？ That is when the behavior doesn't
    match。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's something asynchronous about it that， should cause us to be quite suspicious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now a lot of this asynchronous comes from discomfort。 So I mentioned anxiety
    before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but more broadly there's a discomfort。 So in general liars want the meeting
    to end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they'll be looking at the clock。 They'll be talking about ending the meeting
    or they'll cut the interview short or they'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be very happy if there's a disruption。 They'll welcome that or even look for
    an opportunity to switch topics and do something else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often this discomfort is represented by the desire to create distance。 So liars
    will lean back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they'll lean away or what's been called eye blocking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They'll close their eyes pretending as if they're somewhere else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sort of like the same way we might sort of cover our ears as if we're saying，
    "Oh， I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can't hear you。"， Sometimes people will close their eyes as if I'm not here
    giving themselves this sort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of quick sort of mental vacation from that awkward and comfortable situation。
    So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's the sign of discomfort。 I want to think about why would this person be
    uncomfortable？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You sometimes see artificial barriers。 People put a backpack between them and
    the person interviewing them or they'll cross their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hands or they'll put pencil holders， they'll sort of build a sort of wall between
    them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and somebody else that gives them again the psychological space because they're
    feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: uncomfortable。 Now another thing people will do is engage in self presentation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're constantly trying to create positive impressions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is the reason why we spend more time getting ready before we go out
    on a date or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we interview， we'll try to be particularly focused and attentive， we'll
    try to create。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a positive impression。 It turns out we're trying to create positive impressions
    all the time at work and at home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're trying to create these positive impressions and deceivers are particularly
    intensely trying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to create impressions。 They're trying to create impressions of honesty and veracity
    that might not be true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as they're trying to create these impressions， a lot of deceivers overdo
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what I mean by that is they might be concerned that they're creating an
    impression of anxiety。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so they try to work at doing it in the opposite direction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they stretch out on the couch or they yawn and pretend that they're not anxious
    at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or sometimes they'll even self medicate， they'll drink alcohol or take drugs
    to really lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their anxiety so much they almost seem kind of out of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people will sometimes overdo this drive to appear not anxious or they might
    engage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in statements like， "Oh， I'd never lie to you。"， Or let me tell you the truth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96ef011e4e3e3a46deeb2183949a7221_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Or to be honest with you， again， these are statements trying to convince you
    that they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being honest。 Now some people use these just as a matter of speech but when
    it's unusual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's different， from how people normally speak。 You want to ask yourself why
    is somebody telling me that they never lie to me or they'd always。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've always been taught to tell the truth or it turns out my father's a preacher，
    why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would somebody be sharing that information and often the reason is they're overdoing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their self presentation。 They're trying to convince they're being honest and
    they're working too hard at it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96ef011e4e3e3a46deeb2183949a7221_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now we sometimes try to manage our impressions with other tools。 So group attendance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People sometimes show up with friends or family or prominent members of the
    community。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're trying to bring in other people， "Oh， I know my friend， the judge or
    the city council。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: person， I'm bringing them in to create this positive impression。"， Or we'll
    change our parents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people will work really hard。 For example， changing their clothes or changing
    their hairstyle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is to create this impression as if you're， you know， you really care about how
    I'm appearing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how you're responding to me。 Lacey Peterson is a woman who is pregnant and
    her husband professed a deep interest in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finding where she was and who took her。 And one of the things that he did following
    her disappearance was to change his own appearance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it could have been because he wanted to escape， but he also worked very
    hard at creating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a positive impression。 He dyed his hair。 He was very carefully sort of quaffed
    and shaven。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He did things that were really odd。 It turns out later he was convicted of murdering
    his wife。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we find that some of these appearance changes are really cues of deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I mentioned cognitive load。 We have more on our mind when we're telling
    lies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this leaks out in a lot of ways。 Part of it is we need to do things to help
    us think better and pause fillers like ums。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and aus， they give us time to think。 So people who are lying use more pause
    fillers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They take longer to answer questions as if they're thinking harder， they're
    stalling， for time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes when they're telling stories they add in more irrelevant details。
    Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it gives them more time to prepare。 Now ironically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are sometimes when deceivers are faster to answer almost too fast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those are times when they've had time to prepare， they're anticipating the
    question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they're quick， sometimes too quick with that answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other cognitive load cues are more stuttering。 We see just just articulation
    go down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people just focus on the text of what they're saying and they don't justiculate
    the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might normally do。 So you want to think about what the baseline is for
    normal and then see what people are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually doing and if it's very different that's a big cue for deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now people sizes dilate but many of these cues are difficult to detect in natural
    and。
