  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm here to talk to you about marketing。 So this segment is the marketing
    101， the basics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: principles of marketing。 And my focus is going to be on building strong brands。
    Because of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the essence of marketing is to have a very strong brand。 So let's start off
    with the first question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a very basic question， but， maybe not as obvious as you might think， which is
    what is marketing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: a market to exist is to have an exchange。 And what I'm going to argue is that
    what marketing means is going to differ as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a function of different aspects of those exchange。 So let's look at the basic
    exchange。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have one buyer and one seller。 And I'm going to give a very simplified view
    to make a point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No market's are ever quite this simple。 And I'm going to look at the two extremes
    just to make my point here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the real markets are somewhere in the middle。 But you'll see when I start
    defining this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that it's very useful to use this， kind of simplification。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we think of an exchange between buyers and sellers， on one extreme we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: could have what's called a seller's market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And then the seller's market， what that means is the seller has a product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you want that product， you have to come to the seller。 So the seller
    has all the power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The opposite of that would be a buyer's market， where there's lots of competition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a lot of products out there。 And the buyer has the power。 And what I would
    argue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I think would make sense to you too， if you think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is marketing should not be the same in a seller's market as in a buyer's market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in a seller's market， what marketing tends to be is what we call product
    focus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: marketing。 You have the product， if the customers want it， they're going to
    come to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In that case， you should develop that product to the best of your ability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should innovate in that product。 You should try to reduce costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you should really focus on the product。 Your business objective in a product
    focus market is to sell as much as you can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And profitability from a product focus market is going to come from volume，
    selling as much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as you can。 In the past when we've studied product focus markets， we've shown
    that profitability is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tied to market share。 So market share becomes your business objective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And why does market share increase profitability？ Because the bigger your market
    share。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more your revenues。 And the bigger your market share and your volume。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the lower the product cost， and hence， profitability。 Higher revenues， lower
    costs， more profit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's really the goal of a product focus market。 And when your product focus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where do you get growth？ Will you develop new products based on your product
    experience？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or you go to new markets？ That's product focus marketing。 So what's customer
    focus marketing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it the opposite？ And the answer is going to be no， not exactly。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's quite a different type of marketing。 Let's think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Customer focus marketing means that I need to focus on the customer to get that
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to buy from me rather than the competition。 Well， what's the best way to get
    the customer to buy from you rather than from the competition？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best way to do it is to look at what that customer wants and deliver a product
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meets the needs of that customer。 So where is the product focus market on the
    expert？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I create the very best product I can based on my expertise in a customer
    based market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_20.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Some people call it inside out is product focused and outside in is customer
    focus。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so now we're going to look at what the customer wants to deliver value to that，
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But think about it。 What does the customer want？ Well， the first question is，
    well， which customer？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can't give every customer what they want and we know customers are going
    to want all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different things。 So the reason why a buyer's market or customer focused marketing
    is so different than product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: focus is that every customer out there wants something different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we try to give everybody what they want， we'll go out of business。 That's
    too hard to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the intuition of customer focus marketing is to pick and choose customers，
    deliver value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to some customers， say yes to some customers and no to other customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the process of segmentation。 I'm going to talk about that in the next
    section。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But the idea here is that I go after some customers and I say no to other customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well then how do I become profitable in that？ Understand that in a product focused
    marketing what we did is sell as much as we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We sold that product to anybody who wanted that product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_26.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In a customer focused market we're saying no to some customers and yes to others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_28.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So how do we make that profitable？ And the answer is you pick and choose the
    customers you want to deliver。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: You deliver value to that customer， give them exactly what they want and that
    they're willing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_32.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: to pay for。 And where the profitability comes from is not from volume but it's
    from creating value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_34.png)'
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_36.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well the first thing is if I give you exactly what you want many times you'd
    be willing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pay a premium price。 Then the profitability comes in not from reduced costs
    which we saw in the seller's market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_38.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_40.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If you give me exactly what I want I'll be willing to pay a higher price for
    it。 So that's one way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other way customer based marketing is profitable is by giving the customer
    what they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want time after time after time。 I don't think about just one transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_42.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I think about building customer loyalty and delivering value to that customer
    over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_44.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

    get a little。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_48.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The idea of customer share or share of wallet is that I go out through a more
    narrow market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and try to get more from each of those customers' wallets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_50.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And it turns out that loyalty is very， if you do it right can be very profitable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And why is loyalty more profitable？ Because it's the cost of delivering value
    to the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I'm doing a customer based marketing it's actually quite expensive to give
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer exactly what they want。 Once I figure out what that customer wants
    and I deliver it to them the first time it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_52.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_54.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So it's more difficult and more expensive to acquire new customers but it's
    cheaper to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: retain those customers over time and that's where the profitability comes from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It comes from loyalty。 The other thing if you're thinking about building share
    of wallet in the customer focus market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that I not only sell one product to you I think that other things that you
    might need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I try to cross sell around it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b445825500165f47501be0c247f83929_56.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Let me give you an example of this notion of cross selling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you've ever got into a gap or some gene store and you go to cash register
    and you buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a pair of jeans， the cashier or the person behind the counter might say oh these
    are very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nice jeans。 Do you think you'll need a belt with that？ Do you think you'll need
    socks？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the notion of cross selling。 So I'm selling other things to you besides
    that one specific product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these are the idea of increasing customer share and that's a very important
    part of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer focus marketing。 Give the customer exactly what they want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They'll be willing to pay a premium price for it。 Give them what they want and
    keep delivering value over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They will stay loyal to you and they'll buy over time and that's more profitability
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you understand their needs you can not only sell them one product but you
    can cross。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sell other products that may also meet their needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in a customer base market where profitability comes from is premium price，
    loyalty and cross。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: selling。 The difference between sellers market says you focus on the product
    on what the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: does well and you push that out and in a customer base market you focus on the
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the customer wants and you deliver value to the customer better than the
    competition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the basic difference between product base marketing and customer focus
    market。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What's changed？ Well now not only do you have an exchange between buyers and
    sellers but because of globalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and because of the internet and technology and social media and things like
    that it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not a one-to-one conversation anymore。 Customers can talk to other customers。
    That's good and bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're doing a really good job in meeting the needs of the customers the
    fact that they'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: buzz to their other customers and tell their other friends about what a terrific
    service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your company is doing well that's really good news。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand if something goes wrong and they tell their friends something
    bad well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's not such good news and so you have to be really careful in every transaction
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customer now that you deliver not only value but that you deliver a top-notch
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experience。 Because although what I've been talking about in the sellers market
    and in the buyers market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has focused on transactions in the sellers market I talked about a single transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the buyers market I talk about transactions over time or customer loyalty
    but in the connected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: community if your message is being transmitted by customers to other customers
    they talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customer experience。 What do I mean by customer experience？ Let me give
    you an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It starts way before the transaction and it goes way after the transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example if a customer told another customer about their experience at
    a restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might say well I was driving to that restaurant and I hit a lot of traffic
    then I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got to the parking lot and I couldn't find a parking space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Only when I got into the restaurant I finally got a table the meal was really
    good but then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the end of the meal when I was leaving I tripped and fell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That may be the way they describe the experience at the restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if that's the way your message about your product is going to be transmitted
    from customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to customer then you as a marketer need to focus on the entire customer experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in this。
