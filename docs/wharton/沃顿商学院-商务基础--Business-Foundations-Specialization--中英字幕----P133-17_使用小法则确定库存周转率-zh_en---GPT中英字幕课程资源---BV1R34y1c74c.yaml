- en: In the last video， I introduce our first equation in this course， which we refer
    to as little。

- en: slow。 We learned that on average， in every process， the average inventory is
    equal to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the average flow rate times the average flow time。 Today， we will apply little
    slow to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the world of physical inventories。 For that， we will do something that first
    might appear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really weird。 We will pick an individual dollar bill as our flow unit。 We will
    then think of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a firm as a big black box in which dollar bills flow in on the one side and
    the dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bills flows out on the other side。 We can then ask ourselves a simple question。
    How long。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: does the average dollar bill spend inside the company？ Well， clearly， we cannot
    ask the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dollar bill， "Hey， dollar bill， how long did you spend in the company？" But
    we don't， have to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can use little slow。 More specifically， we think of the number of dollar
    bills flowing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through the organization as a cost of goods sold or cogs， for sure。 The number
    of dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bills inside the organization is the inventory。 If you have taken accounting
    courses， you might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ask about life or or FIFO。 For the purpose of what we are doing， it doesn't
    matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note further that we're using cogs as our flow rate。 I see folks in corporate
    finance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes use revenues， since inventory is valued in cogs' dollar， I prefer
    to use cogs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be consistent。 So let's visualize this。 We have our individual dollar bill
    that goes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into the organization， the inflow， and then we have all the dollar bills coming
    out。 The。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dollar bill in the organization as the inventory。 And the flow of dollar bills
    through the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is really our cogs。 And when we want to know how long does the individual dollar
    bill spend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inside the organization？ There would be the flow time。 Cogs and inventory， we
    can get that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from accounting。 Again， little slow is i equals r times t。 So we're solving
    this for t the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow time， and that tells us how long the dollar bill spends in the organization。
    Sounds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to abstract？ Well， let's do a specific exam。 Let's compare two legendary computer
    makers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compact and Dell， of which of course only one exists by now。 And I will give
    you a reason。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why you probably are not watching this video on a compact computer。 So we're
    going to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little slot to find out how long the dollar bill spent in the organization。
    i equals r， times t。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're going to solve this for t。 Let's start with Dell's numbers。 So the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory at Dell in 2000 was about 391 million。 Again， I will start with old
    data from the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time when compact was still around。 And we have $20 billion a year as the flow
    rate， the， cogs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that is dollars per year times t。 So t is our unknown。 We're going to solve
    this， for t。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so that means 391 divided by 20，000。 And that is expressed now in years。
    So the， unit is years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to convert the years into days， you have to multiply with， 365 days
    in the year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is about seven days。 So Dell keeps their inventory for seven。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: days before spitting it out again。 We refer to this number as days of supply。
    So Dell has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about seven days worth of supply。 Now this is a lot or not， well， let's compare
    this with， compact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the same year， compact had an inventory of roughly $2 billion， $2。003 billion，
    to be exact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And cogs at about 25 billion。 Multiply this with a flowtime t。 Again， we're，
    going to solve for t。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case， it's 2003 divided by 25， 263。 And then again， it's multiplied，
    by 365 days a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we see that the average dollar spends 29 days within compact。 That's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a very sharp contrast to Dell's number。 Again， we refer to this number as a
    days of supply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can read this directly as inventory divided by cogs times 365。 Now instead
    of saying we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to keep the inventory for seven days， I can see I'm going to turn the
    inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: every seven days。 That means a Dell I have about 52 inventory turns per year。
    So the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory turns as cogs divided by inventory。 And that tells us how many times
    I'm turning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the inventory。 So it's one over the flowtime t。 Now this was old data。 I picked
    the date。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the year so that compact and Dell were both still around。 To take Dell's
    numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into perspective， I showed you the data here from 1990 to the very recent past。
    On this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: side slide here， you see that in the early years， this was really the rise of
    the Dell， model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was a revolution in the computer industry。 Michael Dell's idea was that
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can make your computer to order。 So rather than having the computer wait in
    inventory for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customer， the customers waited for the computer。 That went super well。 That
    peaked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at around 80 inventory turns per year in the early 2000s。 The burst of the tech
    bubble。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then happened around 2001。 Dell did a good job at recovering the inventory turns。
    But。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you notice the decline starts before the financial crisis and that has never
    stopped。 So this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e1eb14e74d6688be4929fb8f89ddbe51_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: is really down here now。 Note what you see is not the financial crisis。 It's
    really the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: end of the Dell model。 And that has a lot to do with the fact that nowadays
    as customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't want to wait for our computers anymore。 And we don't ask for customized
    computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The variety has gone down in the industry。 And now companies like Apple， it
    is again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: computers waiting for customers。 It's an irony of history， if you will。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time for a little game。 I call this game the inventory turn scripts。 I will
    show。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you here four retailers， the jewelry maker Tiffany， the supermarket Kroger，
    the apparel， store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kohl's and Walmart， the world world leading retailer。 Then I give you four levels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of inventory turns and your job is to match retailer and inventory turns。 Who
    is who？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Put me on pause and give this some thought。 Alright， here we go again。 So here
    are the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: solutions to the quiz。 Tiffany is the lowest turns。 They turn the inventory
    very slowly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for that is they have a huge assortment。 They provide you lots of
    choice。 And that means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that each of these products， each of these wedding bands or necklaces， is going
    to wait。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a long time for the customer。 Kroger is the other extreme。 Supermarkets turn
    the inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very quickly。 A lot of these items are perishable。 Fresh food inventories have
    to turn almost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: daily。 Kohl， again fashion wants to turn quickly but not as quickly as milk。
    Walmart also somewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the middle has a large grocery component to it。 Very well managed and they
    have pretty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e1eb14e74d6688be4929fb8f89ddbe51_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: decent turns。 Next， think about why do we care about these inventory turns。
    Well inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turns have something to do with inventory costs。 Let me do a thought experiment。
    Imagine you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have a thousand dollar computer and you keep that computer for an entire year。
    How much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will that cost you？ Well over a year that computer gets somewhat obsolete。 You
    have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to store that computer and you have to finance that computer with your weighted
    average cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of capital or WAG for short。 Note that this is not a real out of pocket expense。
    Most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of that is a ride off and an opportunity cost。 But it's an important number。
    A thousand dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: computer I would easily say loses $300 of value in a year。 You might have to
    pay $100。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to store it safely and securely and you might have to pay about 10% of the value
    of the computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of opportunity cost。 So those numbers add up to something pretty big。
    But of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're not holding the computer for an entire year。 As we saw in the case of
    Dell you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turning it multiple times。 And so let's say for sake of argument if that inventory
    costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: per year number is 30% and you're turning it six times per year that means for
    every unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for every computer that you're selling you're incurring a cost of 5 percentage
    points。 That。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: means for a $60 item in terms of cost one item that you source for $60 you would
    incur。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: $3 per unit cost of inventory。 The final comment on inventory cost。 This graph
    shows a relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between profit margins and inventory turns。 Now if you look at this graph you
    might wonder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why I talk so much about inventory turns being good because it seems to be a
    negative correlation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between margins and inventory turns。 You see Tiffany up there was slow turns
    and they make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: big margins。 And you see best buy and Walmart down here and they have fast turns
    and low， margins。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that's not the point。 As I said Tiffany holds a very broad product assortment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have a ring or wedding band for every kind of customer who comes in that
    store。 That。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: means you have to hold the inventory a long time。 That's low turns。 But when
    somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then one set rank oh my god will they pay。 Best buy and Walmart are much more
    in the fast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turning business offering customers less choice。 Look at the competition here
    between the middle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Macy's and the gap。 They're both somewhat in the same product category。 Look
    at the situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here Macy's turns its inventory three times in a year。 Gap turns inventory four
    times， in a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's take a pair of jeans or some other apparel and assume that there are 36%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cost of inventory for holding the item for an entire year。 Again that is the
    cost of storage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the cost of capital and the cost of fashion becoming obsolete。 So that means
    36% with three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turns for Macy that would be 12% unit cost versus at the gap return four times
    that is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a 9% unit cost。 So that little difference in terms of inventory turns is worth
    3% points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of profit margins。 Thus the gap with the faster turns can achieve a
    significant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: financial advantage even though the profit margins on the book might actually
    slightly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e1eb14e74d6688be4929fb8f89ddbe51_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: look lower。 Today we talked about inventory turns。 This is a key concept in
    inventory， planning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: purchasing and supply chain management。 It really captures the costs of inventory。
    These。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: costs are a combination of capital holding costs。 That's an opportunity cost
    of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cost of storage， shrinkage and theft as well as the cost of markdowns because
    of value depreciation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I like about little slow is that it reminds us that the only way we can
    efficiently support。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a big flow of product in the form of big sales is by turning the inventory quickly。
    Some supply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: chain managers talk about turn and earn。 I like that turn and earn the more
    you turn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your inventory the more efficient of a supply chain you run。 For now turn off
    the video you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: earned a break。 See you in the next video。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
