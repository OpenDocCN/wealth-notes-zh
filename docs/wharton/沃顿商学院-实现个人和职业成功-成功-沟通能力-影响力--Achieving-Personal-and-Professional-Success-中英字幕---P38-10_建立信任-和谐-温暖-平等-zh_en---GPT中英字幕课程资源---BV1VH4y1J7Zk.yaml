- en: Repur， warmth， and equality。 Now remember back to homicide detective Marshall
    Frank。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now Marshall Frank faced this challenge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/dc8fe1018a7c6b7dbb3b803e7790857f_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: He was trying to get Paul Roles to confess to murder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now Paul Roles certainly knew if you confess to murder you're going to prison
    for a long。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time for sure。 And yet detective Marshall Frank figured out how to get a confession
    within 30 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How did he do that？ Well it turns out that the key to what he did was building
    rapport。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And he built rapport through a lot of different steps and some of them seemed
    kind of funny。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He essentially treated this， this murderer as if he were a friend。 He sat in
    close to him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact sat in so close their legs were almost touching。 He leaned in when he
    talked to them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He spent most of those 30 minutes not talking about the murder or the victim
    but talking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about family life in general。 Detective Frank talks about I made friends with
    him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is he's making friends。 He's talking about things that friends would talk
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're thinking about this is non-task communication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is rather than getting right down to business he's chit chatting about
    things as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if they were friends and that allowed him to build this rapport， to build a
    sense of friendship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that created a sense of trust that then led to roles revealing all of this information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So acting in a cooperative way in a way that Detective Frank was hoping for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now in general how do we do this？ Well we build rapport by this non-task communication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So rather than getting right down to business we should talk with people about
    local events。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're not their family， their friends， hobbies， recent sporting events。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We do things that aren't about the task at hand but that help build rapport
    that make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it much easier when we do get to the task at hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could also do things like share meals together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could actually go to events together like sporting events together when we
    do things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: together that allows us to build this sense of rapport and that really facilitates
    trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let me tell you about another story。 This was about an election。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It happened in Florida's 22nd District and it was Ron Klein， a neophyte to the
    political， scene。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was taking on Clay Shaw a 13 time incumbent。 Now in this election Ron Klein
    knew his stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was a policy wonk。 He knew the ins and outs and he was ready for Congress。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Clay Shaw was a formidable opponent。 After all he had won over a dozen elections
    before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was ready to take on all challengers but Ron Klein was persistent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out though Ron Klein had a challenge。 He was perceived as competent
    but cold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We think about these perceptions of people。 We often think about them in terms
    of their competence and how warm they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here Ron Klein when he talked about policy seemed competent but he wasn't warm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He wasn't connecting with voters。 Now he brought in these consultants and he
    figured out how to overcome this key challenge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How can he sound articulate but also warm？ So people saw him as a luff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He actually did a practice TV interview with these consultants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He went through the entire practice interview。 At the end the consultant said，
    "Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want you to watch this interview that you just， gave and tell me what would
    you do differently。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He said， "Well， there's actually another point that I would have raised。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's some other material I could have brought in here。"， And Colin said，
    "Look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want you to watch it again and I want you to see that in this， whole interview
    you never smiled。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it seems funny why would we want somebody who's an expert in policy to smile
    but it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turns out if you're running for political office people need a connection they
    need to， trust you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they figured out is that what Klein really lit up with was when he talked
    about， his son。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we talked about his family and they said， "Look， when you go out on your
    political。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stump speeches start off talking about your family， start off talking about
    your son。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then pivot to talking about the key issues in policy。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it turns out as he did that he was able to connect with voters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He demonstrated warmth as well as competence and he was more likable and trusted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we need to do things sometimes that are different from just demonstrating
    pure competence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to instill trust。 In fact， I think about this as a presidential imperative where
    we think about every president。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/dc8fe1018a7c6b7dbb3b803e7790857f_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: since Eisenhower， since the advent of television every US president as they've
    moved into the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oval Office bring with them a dog。 And this imperative is so strong it's true
    even for President Obama who had never had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a dog。 And for good reason one of his daughters， Malia， is allergic to dogs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And yet when they move into the White House， the Obama's went out and bought
    a dog。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a hypoallergenic， dog， but they needed a dog。 And so you think about how important
    it is， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why would you need a dog？ And the key idea here is it projects warmth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you've won a national election， you've demonstrated some competence， it's
    hard to， do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then a key challenge is projecting warmth。 And when you see a president，
    a high power person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you presume competence and then you're， looking for that warmth and having a
    dog does that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you want to do things like spending time with family， sharing stories， personal
    stories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hanging around with a dog。 Those are things that project a sense of warmth and
    they end up building trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Klein talked about a son， presidents end up getting dogs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it's this non-tax communication that's really important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/dc8fe1018a7c6b7dbb3b803e7790857f_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We have experiences that we share in common， like going to sporting events or
    sharing meals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: together， using first names correctly。 Those are things that will build rapport。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we come up with nicknames or we have shared hobbies， we find commonalities，
    those are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things that are going to build rapport。 And that's really an essential ingredient
    for building trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the rapport idea。 And it's related to warmth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea that we can demonstrate warmth when we demonstrate concern for other
    people， we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: demonstrate kindness， we spend time with our friends， our family， with pets
    or volunteering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're demonstrating concern for other people and that concern projects a sense
    of warmth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's a really key component。 There's an affective peace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an emotional peace to trust and we want somebody who's going， to be warm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now one final point related to this is this idea of equality。 Now when we show
    up on time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're demonstrating that our time isn't more valuable than somebody， else's
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's communicating a sense of equality as well as this idea of benevolence
    and warmth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to be equal so we don't sit on a higher chair。 We don't accentuate differences
    between us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can do things like dress in similar ways。 We convey a sense of equality and
    that's also important for building trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're more likely to trust people who seem to not only care about us but also
    treat us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as equal partners。 So taking together here are three key elements。 Building
    rapport。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: demonstrating warmth and demonstrating a sense of equality， they're all。
