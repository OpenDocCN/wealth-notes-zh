    and。

- en: to start with a little bit of motivation。 I know we don't have a lot of time
    but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's worth mentioning a few things。 This is a picture of the top statutory tax。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rate on different sources of income in particular dividends which is the blue，
    line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't want to make too much of this picture but I just want to emphasize a，
    couple of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First you should see that the tax rates are moving all over， the place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's an enormous amount of variation in taxes over time number one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and number two you can see that historically tax rates have gotten， really high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now admittedly it's not clear how to how many people those tax。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rates of 90 95% actually applied but taxes are substantial and they move， around
    a lot over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: investment income。 So let's do illustrate this by example and I want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: revisit an example we looked at in the past in particular in our first lecture，
    on discounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the question is how much do you have to save today to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: withdraw $100 at the end of each of the next four years if you can earn 5%，
    per annum？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well recall the first thing we do is we lay out a timeline and here are， cash
    flows right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to be withdrawing $100 a year over the next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: four years and the question is asking how much do we need today。 So what we
    did is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we discounted each of each cash flow each of the $100 by the 5% discount rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to get the present value。 So for example we took this first 100， 100 divided
    by， what？ 1 plus 0。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 05 and that got us $95。24 approximately。 And we took the second， cash flow 100
    divided by 1 plus 0。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 05 squared that's a 2 and that got us the， second cash flow and on and on and
    then we could add these cash flows because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're all in the same time zero units and that produced our answer of $3。54。60。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay then when we thought about what was going on in the bank account recall。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right we would insert $354。60 into the account it would it would then earn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest at 5% we'd add that to the previous balance and we'd pull out some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: money and that would reduce our balance and we would continue that for four。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: years at the end of the four years we would be less left with nothing。 But now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consider what happens when we have some taxes。 See now we put our $3。54。60 into
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: account that earns interest at 5% but now we have to pay taxes on that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest income and I'm gonna assume the tax rate we're facing is 35% which
    isn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: too far up from the top statutory rate currently prevailing。 So that 35% of
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1773 is 621 in taxes that's gonna reduce our pre withdrawal balance to， $3。66。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 12 then we pull out $100 and then we're left with $2。66。12 at the end of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first year which by the way the $2。66。12 is less than the $2。72。32 because of
    the， taxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if we continue that process we'll get down to zero but only because in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the last year we can only pull out $83。06 that's all we have left in that last，
    year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So on net we're $16。94 short the taxes are reducing the funds available。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for withdrawal we're running out of money early。 So the lesson here is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: taxes reduce the return on our investment the dollar return on our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: investment and one way to account for that is an after tax discount rate I'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: call it Rt and that equals our usual discount rate times 1 minus the tax rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for our example the discount rate R was 5% and the tax rate T was 35% for
    an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after tax discount rate of 3。25%。 Now let's revisit the problem using this，
    after tax discount rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now when I discount all of these cash flows back to， today I'm going to use
    Rt which equals 3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 25% instead of the R which equals 5%。 When we do that when we do the arithmetic
    and add all these numbers up we get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 369。50 a number that's bigger than the 354。60 we originally found with the 5%，
    discount rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's run through the exercise of looking at what happens to， the savings
    account。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now we put in 369。50 that's going to earn interest at 5%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to pay taxes on that interest at a rate of 35% which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generates a pre-withdrawal balance in the first year of 38151。 We pull out the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hundred dollars and then we're left with 281。51。 We continue that process for
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: few more years and at the end of four years we're left with nothing in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bank account and we've been able to pull out a hundred dollars each year。 So
    what's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the implication？ Well we need to save more to withdraw a hundred dollars per。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: year after taxes right in particular we need to save 369。50 as opposed to the，
    354。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 60 and it's also interesting to note that the difference in how much we had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to save the difference between the 369。50 and the 354。60 which equals 14。90
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: equals the present value of the taxes at 5%。 Check this discount these cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flows at 5% and see what the present value is it should be 14。90。 Okay let's。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d7ff193ccaacbcef1962f6c63fa9af08_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: summarize and summarize this and bring it back together。 Taxes reduce our dollar，
    return。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The after tax return is less than the pre-tax return and it's less by a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: factor of 1 minus the tax rate that you're facing。 So we can discount by this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after tax return to see how much money we're going to have once we've swept
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the effect of taxes and given tax rates in the US not to mention most of Europe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and many other countries taxes are significant and can have a huge impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on our cash flow streams our savings behavior and ultimately our decision， making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So looking ahead I want you to dive into the problems work on the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: problem set and then we're going to look at inflation and investigate how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inflation affects our cash flow stream and our decision making。 So thank you
    and I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
