  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everybody welcome back to Corporate Finance。 So last time we introduced taxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we explored the impact of taxes on our cost of capital or discount rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: last approximately 110 years inflation in the United States。 And what you can
    see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a couple things。 First of all over the recent period inflation has been，
    relatively low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you go back beyond say the last 30 years you can see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: periods of really high inflation including deflation。 And so what I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    days it can be。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: revisit the example we've done over the last few lectures。 This example just
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: refresh your memory was you know how much do we have to deposit or save。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: today in an account earning 5% if we want to withdraw $100 every year over the，
    next four years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the answer to that question was $354。60。 We deposit $354。60。 That earns
    interest at 5%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That increases our balance。 We withdraw the money。 That。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reduces our balance and we continue over the next three years。 Until we drive
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: account balance down to zero。 Exactly。 Now the first lesson is inflation is
    not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to affect the money we earn。 It doesn't affect the interest over here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're still going to earn 5% every year a nominal rate of return。 What。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inflation is going to do is it's going to affect what we can buy with the money，
    we're pulling out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to affect the value of that money。 And so we'd like a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way to quantify and understand the impact of inflation on that value。 So I'm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to introduce the concept of a real discount rate。 I'm going to denote
    it by， R。R。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one plus the real discount rate equals one plus the nominal， discount rate。
    Plus， I'm sorry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divided by one plus the expected rate of， inflation which I've denoted by pi。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a commonly used approximation that you'll， see though I'll emphasize this
    is an approximation is that the real rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: equals the nominal rate minus the expected rate of inflation。 So in our， example
    we might have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our discount rate was 5% and if expected， inflation is 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5% which is approximately what it's been over the recent history， in the US。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We get a real rate of return on our investment of 2。44%， substantially lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that's important because even though the， inflation is not impacting our
    account balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much money any dollars we， have， it is impact， it is impacting what we can
    do with that money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we can， buy with it。 And that's ultimately what we care about it。 So let's
    try discounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our cash flows now by the real rate of return R。R which we just showed was，
    equal to 2。44% right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the discounting proceeds mechanically in the exact same， way as it was before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Only now I'm using the real rate instead of the nominal， rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if we do a little bit of arithmetic， we get the present values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of all of these future cash flows。 We add them up and we get a value of， 376。75。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the present value of the sum of all these cash flows。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: taxes affect dollars but inflation does not affect dollars， it affects consumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So each nom or the we earn a nominal return but we can't buy as much with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me illustrate this。 So let's insert here into our savings account the， 376。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 75 that we just computed using the real discount rate。 And see what happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we're withdrawing $100 every year？ Well that money is going to earn interest，
    at 5% every year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We pull out $100 and what's going to happen is we're going to be， left with
    this surplus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that makes sense right because inflation doesn't， affect the dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it affects what we can do with these things that we pull out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See we have extra money here so what we really want to do to address inflation
    is we want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: increase how much we pull out every year。 I don't want to pull out just $100
    each year because prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are going up so that $100 say here in year two can't buy as much food or housing
    or clothes or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whatever we need to buy。 So let's think about what kind of cash flow stream
    we might want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to address inflation。 And one way to do that is to simply solve for the cash
    flows that we want to withdraw each year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: given a nominal discount rate are of 5%。 What is CF？ Well we can solve this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is just elementary algebra right？ And we want to use the nominal rate here
    since that's reflecting the dollars that we're earning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So solving this for CF or cash flow we get 106。25 which is greater than the
    100。 That makes sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're putting in more money at the beginning right？ Remember originally I think
    we were putting in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 354。60 if I remember correctly。 So that we put in more which means we can take
    out more than we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: used to take out。 And let's see what happens now。 So we put in the 376。75 now
    we're going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: withdraw 106。25 each year and we see that we're going to drive the account balance
    exactly to zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with nothing left over。 But ideally we want our withdrawals to increase each
    year to accommodate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inflation right？ I want these withdrawals to go up every year to account for
    the increase in prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the goods that I'm going to purchase， goods and services that I'm going to
    purchase with that money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's think about this。 Well if prices are going up at 2。5% per year that
    means what I could buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with a hundred dollars today I'm going to need a hundred and two dollars and
    fifty cents next year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because prices went up by 2。5%。 They're going to go up by 2。5% again so I'll
    need a little bit more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a little bit more and a little bit more each year。 See what this sequence
    of withdrawals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maintains our purchasing power。 We'll be able to buy the same amount of food，
    the same amount of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: housing， go on the same vacations assuming the prices are all going up by 2。5%
    the expected rate of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inflation。 Now these are all nominal。 These are all nominal values corresponding
    to the real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one hundred dollars of purchasing power。 And so if we take the present value
    of these nominal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dollars at the nominal discount rate we get the 376。75。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We discount nominal cash flows by the nominal， rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep that in mind it's important to emphasize that。 The present value of nominal
    cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the nominal discount rate that's going to equal the present value of the
    real cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the real rate。 Remember that when we were withdrawing a hundred dollars each
    year but we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discounted these at the real rate of return which I think was 2。44% we got 376。75。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all that's going， on is that the inflation term and the numerator and denominator
    of the real computation is they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: canceling one another。 Okay so let's go back to our savings account。 We insert
    the 376。75。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're now going to withdraw money that's growing at a rate of 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5% per year to keep up with inflation。 But our money in the account is earning
    the nominal rate of return of 5%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what happens is we， exactly exhaust our funds at the end of four years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we've been able to do so by increase our， withdrawals each year to keep
    up with inflation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's summarize this。 Inflation does not affect。

- en: dollar returns。 It's not affecting the money in the bank account or the rate
    at which it's growing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What it's affecting is the purchasing power of that money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when I pull it out and go buy something， I can buy less of that good or that
    service with that same dollar year after year after year when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we face inflation。 So we introduce the idea of a real rate of return that takes
    into account the。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: effects of inflation。 Next time we're going to turn to a new topic interest
    rates。
