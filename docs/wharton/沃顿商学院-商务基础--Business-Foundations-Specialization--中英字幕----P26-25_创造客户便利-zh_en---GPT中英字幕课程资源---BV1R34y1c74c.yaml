  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we make sense of what is happening here？ And let's also not forget that
    some of those being disrupted today were actually the disruptors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Sports Authority。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These were the innovators of the day and disruptors of their times and some
    are still around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to understand all this， I think we need to get to basics and start
    with foundations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of how we understand distribution channels and creating customer access。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me start by giving what often people call as an old school tutorial on
    channels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is still just as relevant。 In order for any of us to buy a product or a
    service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two things are important。 We need to have access to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is what we call as relevant information needed to make the purchase and
    we'll talk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more about this in a minute。 And the second is I should be able to execute my
    purchase through the right logistics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the skill of the provider and the importance to the buyer of information
    logistics drives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: optimal channel structure。 So let's think through this a little bit more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we mean by information？ What do we mean by logistics？ So let's think
    about information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First piece of information I need to know is why should I buy this product or
    service？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why should I pay so much for a new idea？ How will it work？ How will I use it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We call this primary information。 And then there is what we call as comparative
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why should I buy from you and not someone else that is comparative information？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every customer needs this in order to decide whether or not to buy a new product
    or a service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the second part is logistics。 There are many components of logistics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Convenience and accessibility。 How far will I have to travel to buy it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am hungry now or I need diapers for my young child。 How much will I have to
    travel to get those？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Will I have to buy 24 bottles of one a day vitamins with each having 120 capsules？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can I buy just one instead of having to buy so many？ How long will it take for
    me to get it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time between order and receipt of goods is important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Who will I go to if the snow blower I just bought doesn't work？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Who will I ask if I have a problem in assembly？ A part is missing or broken。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where will I get it from？ All this falls under logistics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can see a consumer when they are making a decision to buy a product or
    a service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They need to have information about its value， its price， how it works， but
    also needs to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make sure that the product is accessible at the right time， at the right place，
    in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right quantity and of the right type。 Now how do we put together all of this
    in a reasonable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: easy to understand framework？ It requires making a few sort of starting assumptions
    as we call it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditionally one can start by assuming that a manufacturer， somebody let's
    say who makes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shoes say Nike is in a better position to provide information about their shoe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is this shoe more interesting than another shoe？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But intermediary say a retailer of a shoe is probably better at providing logistics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now these are starting assumptions and over time these assumptions change and
    with that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: frameworks will also change。 Now different products and services may have different
    levels of information requirements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and logistic requirements。 Some are high， low on both sides。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if a hospital is purchasing a radically new equipment for say proton therapy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they require a lot of information on whether to buy， which one to buy， but the
    lead for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: logistics is low because they are going to buy it once and never again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not like they are going to buy this every day， every month， so the product
    has to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: available to them at the right time。 It's a one time purchase。 On the other
    hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if the same hospital is going to adopt a new drug that will be used， extensively
    in the hospital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say it's an antibiotic that will be used extensively for many patients， at many
    different times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then the need for information is high。 Why should they adopt this new antibiotic？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But also they are going to have to purchase it extensively repeatedly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the need for logistics is also high。 Think of another situation where either
    us as the warden school or a hospital is going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to replace table lamps that are sitting on a desk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While table lamps are not that complex of product， we are going to buy it maybe
    once every few。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: years。 So the need for information is also low and the need for logistics is
    also low because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: low because it's infrequently purchased。 On the other hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think of buying a surgical supply for a hospital， which is used extensively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I bought it many times before。 So I really don't need to know too much about
    it because I've already purchased it before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I need to make sure it comes to me at the right place at the right time，
    so I'm not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out of stock。 So in this case， the need for information is low， but need for
    logistics is high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now depending on various combination， we can set up different types of customer
    access， structures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， if the need for information is high and the need for logistics
    is low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a one-time purchase， we can go direct to the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's what happens most of the time is these companies have their own salespeople。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they go have interactions with the hospitals and then directly install the equipment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand， if it's a new drug that is going to be adopted by a hospital
    or a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: set of physicians， then of course the pharmaceutical company sales reps will
    go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: convince the doctor， in the hospital why this drug makes sense， why it should
    be adopted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then the hospital does not buy the drug directly from the pharmaceutical
    company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many intermediaries who do that for us。 So we'll call that system
    a pull system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why do we call it pull？ Because the job of the company is to actually create
    the demand for the product and then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the product is then purchased from ancillary and wholesalers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is a framework that we often use to design what we call as structure
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: access or channel design decisions。 Now this is the traditional view of thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What has happened over time is something different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But let's first focus on this to understand how disruptions can happen within
    this framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what this framework argues for is that a particular product or a service，
    the nature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the product or the service determines whether you need high logistics or
    low logistics or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: high information or low information。 Once you have that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then disruption occurs by reallocation of functions。 So I'll just give one example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furniture is a complex product。 We buy it once in a while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It requires high level of information and also high level of logistics。 But
    what did IKEA do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What IKEA said was you can come to IKEA and pick up the furniture but you will
    install， it yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you will assemble it yourself。 So they outsource the assembly and installation
    to the end user。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That does not mean that installation and assembly was no longer needed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People often think of disintermediation as saying something is not needed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The delivery and installation and assembly we still needed in a furniture is
    just that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who did it changed。 Earlier a furniture company did everything themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now IKEA outsourced it to us。 And in the process， we paid less for the furniture。
    Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because we are doing part of the activity ourselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in some ways logistics was spun off to us partly。 Not everything but partly
    to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so IKEA was able to sell the furniture at a lower price to us。 You can look
    at the other side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple stores now have consultative selling in house or online instead of relying
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: value added resellers。 So what Apple did was actually bring in some of the activities
    that the value added resellers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: did in their own house and in the process change the business model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think what this framework says is disruptions can happen through reallocation
    of activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or functions but activities or functions do not go away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the channel margin should be a function of what activities is being
    done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a channel partner does more then you have to pay them more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are doing more then you can pay them less。 Now in today's world when
    we step back a little bit there are other disruptions that are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: possible。 And one of the key disruptors here is technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me think about technology a little bit more broadly than we typically
    think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And typically we think about technology in retail and distribution channels
    we think of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: online buying that we can order something online。 But technology is much bigger
    than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the impact on customer access is far deeper。 Let's think of three industries。
    Books。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: music and let's say money。 I ask my students which of these three industries
    has been most disrupted by technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the typical answer I get is books， Amazon started as a book seller but now
    it's much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bigger and books have been disrupted。 But oftentimes that's not the right answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why have these three industries been disrupted the most？ It's not because we
    can buy books online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's really because today all these three products which were earlier hard goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hard goods I mean book is a hard good。 It's a physical product has been
    converted to a soft good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we mean by a soft good？ Book is now a soft product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can download it on your computer or on your iPad or on your Kindle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about what music was many years ago。 If you were rich enough， you were
    a king or a queen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the musician came and played music， for you and all the poor people may be sat
    on the side and if the wind blew in their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: direction they could hear the music。 But then music gets codified into a tape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then it gets codified into a record。 Some of you may still remember seeing a
    record。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are coming back because they apparently have still better quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then it went from a record to a tape， sorry a CD。 And now what is music？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Music is basically bits and bytes and now it's become a soft good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Money at one point in time was gold。 Then we got paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then from paper we went to plastic and now what is money？ Most people say it's
    just a number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's sitting in your account and sometimes you know it and sometimes you don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what technology has done in all these three industries is convert a hard
    good to a soft， good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a product changes from being a hard good to a soft good， that's when disruption
    happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in my view， the biggest disruption has been for money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Money today is transacted very differently than money used to be transacted
    many years， ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think of books， still many many people read regular books。 They prefer
    to read regular books。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very few people want to have cash。 Many countries have gone cashless。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many industries have tried to go cashless。 So this is an example of disruption
    of technology where a hard good got converted to a soft good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the answer is really not the method of purchase。 It's not online versus bricks
    and mortar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the product itself。 What else we can ask ourselves can change from a hard
    good to a soft good？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What will the world look like 10 years from now？ What will in-home 3D printing
    do 10 years from now？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Will we be able to print a shoe at home？ How about a new car？ I think that world
    is not too far。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: People are arguing that within the next 20 years， many products that are what
    we consider。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as hard goods today will become soft goods that people will be able to just
    print at home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with additive manufacturing。 I can only visualize what customer access will
    look like when that happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think it's really important to understand the role of technology in this
    area more broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than just online versus bricks and mortar。 Thank you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
