    in comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    studied。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: open up their hands， and receive a stone， and then hand the monkey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in this transaction all day long。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    they see a neighbor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a grape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can see what happens。 [ Silence ]， I want to highlight three things about
    this video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is how intensely focused the one catchment monkey is， the one who's
    getting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    neighbor getting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the grape。 The second is， I want to focus on how upset this catchment monkey
    is。 And then third。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wanting to participate where the stone now no longer becomes worth a cucumber。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's all relative。 That is， it's because some other catchment monkey is
    getting a better deal that this original。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deal that seemed fine is no longer okay。 And it's not just monkeys。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to argue that we're hardwired to make these comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and these comparisons really influence us。 So if we take us to Scott Crabtree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here's somebody who's working for a tech firm， was， perfectly happy with his
    job， felt motivated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    hotshot employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This new employee came in at almost the same salary that he had taken years
    to develop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    was so upset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He actually ended up quitting。 He joined a different firm where he became the
    chief happiness officer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a4c2127aeed86ae3a89e3140cfdea88f_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So just as a catchment monkey， Scott Crabtree， when he realized that somebody
    else was getting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a deal that seemed better than his， a younger person with almost the same salary，
    he ended。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not just individuals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tough financial straights。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They were on the verge of bankruptcy。 They negotiated assidiously with their
    unions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the pilots union， the flight attendants， the， bag channellers， the mechanics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they got them to agree to incredible concessions。 So unions together， they
    agreed to 1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 8 billion dollar concessions。 Now at the same time， the executives at American
    Airlines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they could have left American Airlines， for other more stable companies and
    they tried to retain those executives and to retain them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they were giving them retention bonuses。 Now here's the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was an SEC filing deadline and this information became public。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So just after the unions had agreed to steep concessions， they learned that
    the executive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: team was going to end up with these retention bonuses。 Well you can imagine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just like the catchment monkeys， they became furious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the concessions were acceptable until they found out that somebody else was
    getting paid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a bonus。 And the first thing they did was they fired their negotiator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to negotiate。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

- en: So here's the question， is a stonewort the cucumber？ Are 1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 8 billion dollars in concessions reasonable？ Am I getting paid a fair salary？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And for all of these questions， the answer is well， it depends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we have comparisons that inform our answers。 Now let's go to the United
    Kingdom and I think about two brothers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: David and Ed Miliband。 These are two brothers， they grew up together and they
    both were members of parliament in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the United Kingdom。 And when Gordon Brown stepped down as the head of a Labour
    Party。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they were both vying， for leadership。 The older brother David first announced
    that he was going to run for leadership。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank by 15 members of parliament， he announced his candidacy and he seemed
    like the odds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on favorite。 There were several other candidates that also threw their hats
    in the ring in addition to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: David and Ed。 But these were the two primary contenders。 And as the voting went
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: David had a slight edge。 So in the first round， David was beating out Ed。 In
    the second round。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the same。 And the third round， the same。 But the gap became a bit narrower。
    Now to win。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you need an outright majority， you need more than 50 percent and that's exactly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what happened in the fourth round， just the two of them and now all of a sudden，
    Ed wins。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now two things about this。 One， it's a very narrow margin of victory and the
    counterfactual of something else happening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is quite salient。 And two， these are brothers and worse for David， it's the
    younger brother。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what happens is they end up， their relationship ends up fracturing and David
    talks about the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: permanent， the permanent， invidious comparison made professional life impossible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He not only leaves parliament， he actually leaves the United Kingdom， he leaves
    to work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a nonprofit in New York。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a4c2127aeed86ae3a89e3140cfdea88f_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So here this comparison is driving him crazy。 Now for similar reasons， we can
    think about twins。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now one idea is you think， well what's an artificial twin？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An artificial twin is adopting someone that's similar in age to a biological
    son or daughter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what would be great about it is you have a built-in playmate。 There's an
    economies of scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's one carpool。 You have one school， you can have one soccer drop off。
    It could be great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And yet adoption experts， Sam will join later， argues against the corrosive
    social comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are created by artificial twins。 That is by doing this， there's always
    going to be some twin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of those twins that's， going to be out ahead of the other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There could be developmental differences and that constant comparison is going
    to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: artificial twins really toxic。 And so many agencies not only counsel but almost
    prohibit the adoption of artificial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: twins。 Now let's think about something else。 Let's think about doing better
    but feeling worse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How could that happen？ Now again， it's going to be comparisons that help us
    unlock this puzzle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's think about Abel Kiviat。 He was a silver medalist in 1912。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a4c2127aeed86ae3a89e3140cfdea88f_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And this Olympics， the first Olympics where they used a photo finish to determine
    who had， won。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And by a tenth of a second， he came in second。 This was 1912。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now here's an interview he gave in 1990， almost 80 years later， he talks about
    waking up， thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the heck happened。 He's languishing and the intense counterfactual of had
    he only run just a bit faster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a4c2127aeed86ae3a89e3140cfdea88f_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: have come in first。 It turns out that this intense feeling is not just unique
    to Abel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's actually incredibly prominent where you see silver medalists chronically
    express。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dissatisfaction。 A couple of academic articles have studied this。 In terms of
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the silver medalists， where you have silver medalists who look downright， distraught。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really unhappy。 And in fact， by contrast， you see bronze medalists who end up
    looking much happier than their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: silver medal counterparts。 So in this study， almost all the gold medalists are
    smiling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the bronze medalists are， smiling a little bit less often。 But in these
    studies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: none of the silver medalists were smiling。 If you think about these comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the silver medalists， like Abel， are comparing， themselves to the gold medalists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That would have been a lot better。 When you compare silver to bronze， they're
    kind of similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the bronze medalists， if silver is kind of close， that's not a very big
    upper comparison。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But to fourth place， that's a chasm。 There you're just an athlete， not a medalist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the bronze medalists are delighted to have escaped that other fate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we see this doing better but feeling worse phenomenon in these medalists
    where silver。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: medalists are often downright miserable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a4c2127aeed86ae3a89e3140cfdea88f_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So here we can think about this important lesson where comparisons can drive
    us， they can motivate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: us， but they can also make us perfectly miserable。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
