 Welcome back to Corporate Finance。 Last time we introduced the new topic discounted。



![](img/e8bf77855d8ecdd50d035d37b21fec8a_1.png)

 cash flow analysis by discussing how corporations or people more generally。

 should be making decisions。 We discussed several different decision criteria。

 focusing in particular on three the NPV rule， the IRR rule and the payback， period。

 We also discussed how in practice we should be taking a practical。

 approach and using the relevant information from all three rules。 Today。

 I want to talk about free cash flows， a critical element in implementing any of。

 those decision rules。 Let's get started。 Hey everybody welcome back to Corporate， Finance。

 Today we're going to start in on lecture two of discounted cash flow， analysis。

 Up before doing so let's do a brief recap of our last lecture。 So we。

 introduced the topic discounted cash flow analysis by discussing decision， making。

 And we talked about several different decision rules used in。

 practice beginning with the NPV rule which is nothing more than the difference。

 between the present value of costs and the present value of benefits。 And while。

 most academics including me will argue that this is the best rule that you， should always use。

 I take a practical view and recognize that other rules such as。

 internal rate of return and payback period contain relevant information for。

 decision making that if used wisely and in recognition of their limitations can。

 make can lead to better decisions。 And so that's sort of the overarching。

 approach we're going to take to DCF is that there are several different decision。

 rules will rely on NPV but use what we can from other decision rules。 Now in this。

 lecture I want to talk about sort of the bedrock or the found one of the key。

 components of any DCF and any sort of decision making and that's free cash。

 flow specifically what is it。 So let's get started。 So remember there are two， components to NPV。

 There are free cash flows and there's a discount rate。

 because NPV as you recall from last time is little more than just a discounted。

 stream of cash flows in this case free cash flows。 So recall NPV was formally。

 defined as follows and we recognize that this is really nothing new。 This is。

 what we've been doing all along。 What I'm going to focus here is on the。

 numerator the free cash flows。 How do we get at these free cash flows in a。

 corporate setting when whether it's capital budgeting or valuation more。

 broadly how do we compute these FCFs。 That's what this lecture is really about。

 So let's let's take a look。 Free cash flow begins with revenue or sales。 We。

 subtract off costs and then we subtract off depreciation actually。

 depreciation and amortization but mostly depreciation by depreciation or， amortization both。

 Now you might wonder well first what is depreciation。

 Depreciation is just a countenance way of recognizing the loss in value the。

 deteriorate deterioration and value of physical assets like plants and。

 equipment but it's sort of an accounting notion。 It doesn't represent a true。

 cash flow right when a plant depreciates it's not as though money is leaving the， company。

 So you might wonder why we're even considering it。 Well the reason we're。

 considering it is because we're going to take this term in parentheses that I've。

 now bracketed and multiply it times 1 minus TC。 TC is the marginal tax rate。

 See even though depreciation doesn't represent any dollars flowing out of。

 the company or away from a project it's not a literal cost in terms of， dollars。

 What it does is it does reduce our taxable income it provides a tax。

 shield and so we have to take that into account when computing free cash flows。

 because taxes are actual dollars leaving the company or the project。 Now this。

 quantity here goes by several names they're all synonyms。 Unlevered net income。

 net operating profit after taxes or notepad or earnings before interest after， taxes EBA。

 Once we have this we're gonna have to add back in depreciation and again。

 that's just to net out the subtraction of depreciation here。 It doesn't represent。

 a true cash flow what it does represent is a tax shield so we add back in the。

 depreciation then we're going to subtract off you get rid of that capital。

 expenditures or any investments we have to make and then finally we're gonna。

 subtract off the change in networking capital and that sometimes throws people。

 for a little bit what do you mean subtract off the change in networking， capital。

 Well first what is networking capital？ Well networking capital NWC is。

 equal to current yeah that that's supposed to be a U。 Current assets minus。

 current liabilities and current assets that's loosely cash plus accounts。

 receivable plus inventory and current liabilities we're gonna focus on， accounts payable。

 Now some of you might say what about short-term debt or long-term。

 debt that's coming due that's financing leave that aside that's a separate issue。

 we'll talk about that a little bit in a little bit okay so what goes into the。

 free cash flow calculation is not networking capital the change is important。

 because these are all what economists call stock variables and we're trying to。

 compute flows so we want to look at the change the period over period change in。

 networking capital and subtract that from free cash flow。 So what what is free cash。

 flow intuitively well it's the residual cash flow that's left over after all。

 of the projects requirements have been satisfied and the implications accounted。

 for it's the cash flow that can be distributed to the financial claimants of。

 the company debt and equity that's another way to view it it's not the same as a。

 counting cash flow from the statement of cash flows but we can derive free cash。

 flow from the statement of cash flows actually with just a few steps now I want。

 to be precise here the free cash flow we we're gonna compute here or is defined。

 right here this is unlevered free cash flow and I say unlevered to distinguish it。

 from free cash flow to equity or free or or levered free cash flow which we'll。

 discuss on the next slide so free cash flow to equity starts with free cash。

 flow the definition of free cash flow that's just this quantity right here and。

 then we've added well we've appended two terms we're gonna subtract off the。

 after-tax interest cost and add back in any net borrowing that is borrowing。

 above and beyond any repayment of debt so another way to compactly write the。

 free cash flow to equity is that it starts with unlevered free cash flow the。

 free cash flow available to debt and equity holders and we subtract off the。

 after-tax interest expense and add in the net borrowing so what is free cash。

 flow to equity it's the residual cash flow leftover after all the projects。

 requirements have been satisfied implications accounted for and all debt。

 financing has been satisfied that's that's critical we take care of the debt。

 holders for us because they're senior claimants free cash flow to equity is。

 the cash flow that can be distributed to the shareholders equity holders of the。

 project or the company and free cash flow to equity this is look at it this。

 should be there we go is more precisely levered free cash flow because free cash。

 flow to equity is affected by the the company's choice of financial structure。

 it's a leverage decision how much debt it plans to take on so let me show you。

 this what we've just discussed schematically in terms of a hierarchy that。

 that's kind of getting us a little bit close to an income statement right。

 remember free cash flow starts with up at the top with revenue we're gonna pull。

 out the depreciation well yeah the revenue comes in we're gonna pull out the。

 depreciation and costs we're gonna pull out our taxes that's gonna give us our。

 unlevered net income this is our no-pat or our EBA then we're gonna add back in。

 the depreciation because it's a non-cash expense and again that could be。

 depreciation and amortization we're gonna subtract off our capital。

 expenditures our investment requirements we're gonna subtract off our。

 investment in networking capital the change in networking capital and that's。

 gonna give us our unlevered free cash flows these are the cash flows that can。

 go to debt holders and equity holders then we're gonna pull subtract out our。

 after-tax interest expense and I say after-tax because remember interest is。

 tax deductible right it provides us a tax shield and then we're gonna add back。

 in and in that borrowing so if the company borrows some company borrows some。

 company borrows some debt in excess of what it repays that's a cash inflow。

 that's available for use by the equity holders and what we're left with down here。

 at the bottom is the levered free cash flow or the free cash flow to the。

 equity holders so strategic decisions a useful way to think about strategic。

 versus financial decisions is that strategic decisions are gonna affect the。

 inputs to free cash flow well and free cash flow to equity but they're。

 impacting here right strategic decisions are gonna affect our。

 market share and our revenue they're gonna affect our cost our。

 investment decisions right investment decisions are our operations you know。

 inventory and the like all of these strategic decisions are gonna impact our。

 unlevered free cash flow and ultimately our levered free cash flow。

 financing decisions are down here they're gonna impact our leverage choice the。

 the after-tax interest expense the net borrowing okay and hence that that's why。

 we refer to these cash flows here as unlevered they're unaffected by leverage。

 choices now strictly speaking that's not always true in more advanced value。

 valuation courses you might see financing decisions feeding back on some of the。

 inputs into unlevered free cash flow such as the ability of a firm to invest or。

 or its revenue growth but a useful benchmark and a common benchmark is。

 just is just to recognize that financing financing decisions do not affect the。

 unlevered free cash flow and that's a great way by the way to check your。

 computations in any sort of valuation or DCF exercise at least one way is by。

 recognizing that financial policy is not going to hit the unlevered free cash。



![](img/e8bf77855d8ecdd50d035d37b21fec8a_3.png)

 flows all right so let's let's summarize this now。



![](img/e8bf77855d8ecdd50d035d37b21fec8a_5.png)

 you know NPV is a decision rule that's going to quantify the value implications。

 of decisions that that's what we learned last time and it there's two key。

 components to it right there's free cash flows and discount rates this lecture。

 was all about how do we put some meat behind that FCF term how do we actually。

 compute it how do we derive it for a project or a firm more more more broadly。

 speaking and what we saw is that there's a relatively simple formula for computing。

 free cash flows and don't be misled by its simplicity it applies broadly yeah we。

 can always use this definition the trick in practice is actually estimating the。

 components and figuring out what hits unlevered free cash flow versus levered。

 free cash flow what's relevant for cash flow what's not relevant for cash flow。

 and the remainder of this topic is going to be geared towards answering those。

 questions in the context of an actual example so coming up next we're going to。

 start in on forecast drivers are trying to understand how we're going to forecast。

 each of those components of free cash flow out into the future thanks so much。
