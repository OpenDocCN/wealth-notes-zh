    to De Sapio。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They just knocked on De Sapio's door on day one。 He wouldn't have listened to
    him。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you will sometimes be in these strong positions。 What is the greatest risk？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The greatest risk is a coalition against you。 So we all need to be on the lookout
    from both sides for these coalitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And finally， failures of implementation are almost invariably failures to build
    successful。
