  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this session， we shall talk more about how do you actually formally measure
    price elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6a5c2645737da7af1927b748416ba0c8_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Earlier we discussed sort of drivers of price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the situations where consumers are more or less price sensitive？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's talk about how do you actually go about measuring price elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take note of one thing。 Earlier I was using the word price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I'm going to use the word elasticity。 So why am I using the word elasticity
    and how do we define elasticity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So elasticity is defined in a very specific way。 Is defined as what is your
    percentage change in demand when you change your price by 1%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it looks very complicated。 So the first question you can ask is why worry
    about percentage change in price and percentage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: change in demand。 Why not just talk about change in demand divided by change
    in price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That could also be defined as elasticity but we don't do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why do we use percentage change in demand and percentage change in price？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are two advantages of doing this and there are others too but let's
    focus on， those two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first important benefit is let's say you are looking at soap。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you measured the quantity of soap in bars of soap you'll get one number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you measured it in tons of soap you'll get another number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you just use change in demand and change in price you'll get a different
    answer depending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on whether your demand is measured in tons or in bars of soap。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Same way if your price is measured in dollars versus euros you'd get a different
    answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want that。 We want the measure of elasticity to be not dependent on
    the units in which we measure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: demand or the units in which we measure price。 So if you use percentage it's
    unit less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you use percentage demand it's also unit less。 So that's one advantage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One advantage is because it is not specific to units you can also make good
    comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across industries and across firms。 You can say demand for gasoline is more
    or less elastic than say demand for soap or demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for orange juice。 So you can make comparisons across industries because it's
    not specific to a particular unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of tons or dollars。 So across industries comparisons become easier
    and more meaningful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we've defined elasticity let's look at another concept which is elastic
    or， inelastic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People often use the phrase demand for my product is elastic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Others might say demand for my product or my service is inelastic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we mean by it being elastic or inelastic？ What we are really talking
    about is the effect of price changes on revenues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say I were to increase my price by 1%。 If I increase my price by 1% the
    question we ask ourselves is what will happen to revenues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your demand is very elastic then you increase your price your unit sales
    will go down quite。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a bit your revenues will actually go down。 If your demand is inelastic and you
    increased your price by 1% then your unit sales are not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to go down as much and your revenue will increase。 So let's look at in
    specific terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I increase my price by 1% because I increase my price let's say my unit sales
    go down by， 2%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What will happen to my revenues？ They will go down。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because I increase my price by 1% but unit sales went down by 2%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is it or another condition where I increase my price by 1% but unit sales
    only went down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by 1/2% percent。 Now my revenues will go up。 Why？ Because the increase in price
    was 1% the unit sales were only decreasing by 1/2% so my revenues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will go up。 So what is the break even point？ The break even point is going to
    be 1 which means if my demand goes down by exactly 1%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then my price goes up by 1% then my revenues will not change but if my demand
    goes down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by more than 1% then my revenues are going to go down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's talk a little bit about how we measure price elasticity more formally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there are thousands of ways to measure elasticity。 How do you put some structure
    on this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way to put some structure on this is ask ourselves what are we measuring
    and then how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are we measuring it。 So we could be measuring actual purchases focusing on what
    people actually are buying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or we could be focusing on people's intentions to buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other side we look at conditions of measurement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are we measuring price elasticity in natural setting where consumers habitually
    buy or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are we controlling the setting using some experimental methods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you combine the variables we measure along with conditions of measurement
    we broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get four different ways to measure price elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at the very first one on the top left。 Actual purchases in a natural
    setting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what we call as sales data。 We can get sales data from our products
    that are already on the market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can get sales and price data and then we can do something with it to figure
    out elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll talk more about it。 Alternatively we could in a very natural setting conduct
    a survey and ask people about their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: intentions to buy。 We could conduct some experiments and then finally we could
    do some even fancier analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like trade off analysis or con joint analysis by the way con joint analysis
    was developed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the warden school by one of our senior colleagues Paul Green along with Professor，
    Jerry Wendt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's a warden home grown product and we'll talk about this a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at each of these boxes in a little bit more detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's look at the example where we conduct surveys。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say I have a new online news service and I want to estimate price elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the things I could do is I could look at 600 representative potential
    uses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of this product。 I could split them into six sub samples of 100 each and to
    each of these sub samples I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: describe in some detail what this new product is and then ask them whether they'll
    be buying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this or not or using it or not。 So but the way I do it is to each of these six
    groups I give them a different price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So everything else about the product is described in exactly the same way but
    to one group I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say the price is $10 will you buy it to another group I say the price is $11
    will you buy it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the next group I say 15 and then for each of these groups I count the number
    of yeses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then I plot them on a graph。 If you look at this graph you count the number
    of yeses it's higher at 10 lowest at 15。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can look at this and I say I have a demand function which relates price to
    demand and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from this I can compute elasticity。 So that's one way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now clearly as you listen to me you must have said there are many weaknesses
    of this method。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and yes there are but before we look at weaknesses let's look at some of the
    strengths。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's quick it's not as expensive and of course there are many weaknesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the biggest weaknesses people often don't say don't do what they say
    they will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do and this in marketing we call as the intentions behavior link。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are ways to strengthen the intentions behavior link we are not going to
    cover this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in this module but there are definitely ways to do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The method also does not explicitly account for competitor prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's another important weakness especially in a service setting or a repeat
    purchase setting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You ask the question will you buy this product？ You didn't ask the question
    how often will you buy it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How long will you buy it？ Because your total revenues are not going to depend
    on whether people are going to just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: try this service but it's also going to depend on how long they are going to
    buy it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How long they are going to use it and as Professor Feda said what is the customer
    lifetime value？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's one method。 Another alternative could be we launched this service
    in the marketplace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we observed it， for a few weeks and we changed prices during that time and when
    we changed prices we observed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different sales so now we have hard sales data。 Once we have these data we could
    plot these data or we could estimate some statistical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: models to estimate price sensitivity。 For example we could run a regression
    on sales against price and see what is the formal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relationship and from that we could estimate price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could conduct some field experiments。 For example we could change prices
    in one setting compared with another price in another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: setting and look at the difference。 So a very nice example of a field experiment
    is from a research paper published by one of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our own faculty members at Wharton， Professor Steve Hooke and some of his colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He did this experiment when he was at Chicago and they co-opted a very well-known
    retail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: store in Chicago called Dominics。 If you happen to be from that area you may
    be familiar with this store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This store had 90 odd stores and they split them into three groups about evenly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For one of the groups they lowered prices by 9% for the second group they increased
    prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by 9% and the third group they kept the same。 And the third group is often referred
    to in experiments as the control group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what were the results？ Well the results were very intriguing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the stores where they lowered the price by 9% the unit sales went up by
    3%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the stores where they increased the price by 9% unit sales went down by
    4%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me ask you what was the price elasticity observed based on what we covered？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We lowered the price by 9% sales went up by 3%。 What was the definition of price
    elasticity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Percentage change in demand divided by percentage change in price。 Percentage
    change in price is 9%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Percentage change in demand 3%。 Elasticity minus one third 3 divided by 9。 Why
    is it minus？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because when you are raising price sales are going down and when you are lowering
    prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sales are going up。 So elasticity observed in the stores where we lowered the
    price by 9% was one third。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does that mean？ Was the demand elastic or inelastic？ And the answer is
    it was inelastic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we increased the price by 9% how much did sales go down by？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They went down by 4% from 100 base to 96。 Then you see 4 divided by 9 is less
    than 1 which means we raised the price by 9% unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sales went down by 4%。 Again your revenues would have gone up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in both these cases we observed that the demand is relatively inelastic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what would be the conclusion from the grocery store managers perspective？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well one conclusion could be because my demand is inelastic I can raise prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My revenues will go up。 That looks like a nice conclusion but you have to be
    a little bit careful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why do you have to be a little bit careful if consumers are able to compare
    prices more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: easily then maybe these effects will no longer remain valid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if another competitor store were to emphasize that Dominics has raised prices。
    They highlight it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they make it more accessible to the consumer， make consumers more sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then maybe some consumers may shift stores but what do we find usually is consumers
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quite sticky when it comes to the stores they buy from and maybe that's one
    of the reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are seeing low price elasticity in these settings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's one way to measure elasticity is to conduct a field experiment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last method we are going to talk about is trade off analysis or conjoined
    analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I will just give you a sense of what this method is to give you an idea of
    how this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is done and then of course there are more formal ways of doing it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are companies that specialize in conducting this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may talk to one of those or read more about it in a book。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at the following example。 Let's say we have six restaurants A，
    B， C。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: D and E and F and we have these restaurants， are defined on two different characteristics
    or two different sort of attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is the quality of their food and other is the atmosphere or the ambiance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the food quality can be either excellent， good or fair and the ambiance is
    either intimate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: candlelight or bright lights。 Now with these three food quality and two types
    of ambiance we can create six different types。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of restaurants。 So I have done this in a very purposeful way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's say I ask one of the consumers or potential buyers， you know tell
    me which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is your most preferred restaurant and let's say this person says is the most
    preferred， restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then I ask them the next question。 Because A were not available which is the
    next restaurant you will pick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say this person says B and then I tell them if B is not available which
    one will， you pick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They say C。 In effect what I'm trying to do is ask them to rank order these
    restaurants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's look at another customer。 Let's say ask them which is your most preferred
    restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They say A。 I ask say A is not available which one do you pick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They say C and I say that's not available which one do you pick and they say
    E。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if you look at A B C versus A C E would you not agree with me that you learned
    something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about these consumers。 What did we learn？ Consumer number one cares mostly about
    the food quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consumer number two cares much more about ambiance than food quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this is just to give you an idea that we are able to judge from these choices
    in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very purposeful way。 Does the customer care more about food quality or ambiance？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can then quantify it also more formally as to how much more do they care
    about food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quality versus ambiance。 Now let's think about one of the variables instead
    of being food quality could be price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So then we can say how much does the person make a trade-off between price and
    food quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that will allow us to measure price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So looking back there are four broad ways of measuring price elasticity and
    these four。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: broad ways come about from what do we measure and how do we measure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are we measuring people's actual purchase behavior or are we measuring their
    intentions， to buy it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of how we are measuring are we measuring it in their natural setting
    and then are we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: measuring it in a controlled experimental setting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this 2 by 2 table that we discussed gives you four broad different ways and
    what we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: did in this module was to give examples of each one of those four different
    ways of。
