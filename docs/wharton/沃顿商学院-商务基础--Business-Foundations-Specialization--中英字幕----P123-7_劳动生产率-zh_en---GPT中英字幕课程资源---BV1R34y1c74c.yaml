  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I will introduce two measures of labor productivity， the average labor utilization
    and the cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of direct labor。 I then want to spend some time with you reflecting upon the
    financial importance of labor productivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's go back to the Excel model that we had started in the last video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have the three resources here。 Remember we had the processing times， the
    capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the way down to the cycle time。 Now imagine you and I would run the separate
    restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are the owners。 We pay the workers。 What would make us really angry？ Exactly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have a worker that sits or stands there and is not working。 We say the person
    is idle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much idle time do we observe in this picture here right now？ Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's for the moment assume that we have unlimited demand or a really big number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of customers asking for our sandwiches。 Where are you going to go see the idle
    time？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Who is sent around doing nothing？ Well worker number two， the bottleneck is
    never idle。 In contrast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the other two workers have some slack relative to the longer processing time，
    of worker number two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that number is simply the cycle time minus the processing time of that station。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first person has an idle time of nine seconds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again the bottom of the neck will not have any idle time and the third one has
    again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nine seconds of an idle time。 The total idle time we get by summing up all the
    idle times for the individual stations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and voila that gives us a grand total of 18 seconds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now 18 seconds are large number or is it a small number？ That's really hard
    to interpret。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In absolute terms it's really hard to judge。 So we need to take this number
    relative to something else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me introduce another measure。 I will refer to this number as the labor content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The labor content is simply the sum of all the processing times that involve
    labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our case here we get a labor content of 120 seconds per sandwich。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these 18 seconds of idle time should be compared to the 120 seconds of making
    a， sandwich。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast in an autoplanet 18 seconds of total idle time relative to maybe，
    10。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 seconds of labor content for a car would be far less significant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the intuition behind of what I now will really find as the labor utilization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Labor utilization looks at the labor content。 For every sandwich I'm going to
    get 120 seconds of labor but I need to pay the workers for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the 120 seconds at their work plus the 18 seconds they are idle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It ratios called again the labor utilization。 Don't worry for now about the
    details we're going to go and review all the definitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: later on in this video。 So the labor utilization looks at the labor content
    relative to the idle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can write this slightly differently。 Again， I will summarize this on a PowerPoint
    slide later on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For now I look at the labor content and rather than dividing it by the labor
    content by the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: idle time I can divide it by three times the cycle time。 It shouldn't surprise
    us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This gets us the same utilization from a moment ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let me emphasize what labor utilization measures。 Labor utilization measures
    balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Balance is good but it's not the only thing that matters。 Just as a thought
    experiment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imagine I have three very lazy but really smart employees。 What are they going
    to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they tell each other， "Look， Christian is a kind of stupid manager。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's going to look at the labor utilization to judge our performance。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why don't we all slow down and everybody has a processing time of 60 seconds？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While what happens to the labor utilization with this evil plan， if all the
    workers have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a processing time of 60 seconds there will be no idle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process is perfectly balanced and the labor utilization goes to 100 percent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Has this process become more efficient？ Clearly not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we need another measure here for labor productivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me propose another measure which I'll refer to as the costs of direct labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's the cost of direct labor？ What we're doing with this measure is we look
    at the wages per unit of time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's assumed for now we have three people here and we pay each of them 12 bucks
    per。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hour and over that hour we've created ourselves a flow rate of what we said
    was 78 sandwiches。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the cost per sandwich in terms of direct labor is 46 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about this the next time you're going to a subway restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You typically tend to pay around 5 to 6 bucks for a footlong sandwich and in
    there there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d8e414833c53ee2a9f2e0164d0c4f680_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: are about 46 cents of labor。 Just as before we have the three resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The processing time is about 37， 46 and 37。 So those are the workers， one， two
    and three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We found that the cycle time is driven by the second resource 46 seconds per
    sandwich。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means the other two resources one and three have some slack relative to
    the cycle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time and that slack is going to be their idle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they have 46 minus 37 which is 9 seconds of idle time each and we're going
    to get a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grand total of 18 seconds of idle time。 But how do we interpret that number？
    Is it big？ Is it small？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to take it relative to something and that something we said is going
    to be the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: labor content。 Labor content， this is some of the processing times， 37 plus
    46 plus 37。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the 120 seconds。 So when we're going to judge whether the 18 seconds are larger
    or small。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to， take them relative to those 120 seconds。 That gives us the labor
    utilization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so one way of computing labor utilization is taking the labor content of
    120 seconds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is really the green here in my three bars， 120 seconds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And taking it relative to the total which is a green plus a red。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That measures balance and we found the number to be 86。9%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's one way of computing that number。 There's another way you can do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For reasons I don't want to tell you right now， I would prefer you use this
    other way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is by involving the cycle time。 You see the definition here to the
    left。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this definition you're going to go and look at again the labor content，
    so it's 120， seconds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And dividing it now by three times the cycle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you see just as before we get 120 divided by 138 and surprise the price，
    we get the same， 86。9%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the average labor utilization as a measure of balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And finally we talked about the cost of direct labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For that you just look at the wages per unit of time， three workers for $12
    per hour divided。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the flow rate which we found to be 78。something which is expressed in sandwiches
    per hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the per hour cancels out and we're left with the 46 cents per unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That gives us the cost of direct labor。 Before we talk more about labor productivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let me address a question that I oftentimes， get asked。 Does labor productivity
    really matter？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's some cost data from the order industry compiled by a gentleman， Dan
    Woodney， at MIT。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what Dan looked at is the total cost for an OEM in the order industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case the data was from Daimler。 The total cost you can basically find
    in the profit and loss statement in the accounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of Daimler and from the total cost for Daimler you notice that the vast majority
    of costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sit in purchasing。 About 70% of the total cost is going to be in purchasing
    and only a relatively small piece。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the total cost is going to be labor costs。 Most of the costs are coming through
    our purchasing department。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Daimler pays relatively little money in labor。 So why care about labor productivity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would agree that this view is a little bit misleading because keep in mind
    that the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 70% of costs that Daimler spend from those 70%， those are the total costs that
    go to their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: suppliers and these suppliers in turn also incur labor costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you factor in the labor that the suppliers like Bosch or Continental spend，
    if you factor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those in as well， the total percentage of costs making a vehicle is getting
    much larger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're not on Daimler's book but they're real costs。 Now the suppliers again
    have their suppliers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we call those as second tier suppliers， and， those have suppliers of their own。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we roll this up off of the value chain， you do see that they are a fair bit
    of costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sitting around in labor。 The raw material costs are much smaller than you think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That has a couple of important implications。 First and foremost pennies matter
    in a product but oftentimes these pennies will not be on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your book。 You really have to go out and work through the supply chain and find
    these costs somewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: upstream。 By the way， the same is true for improving your carbon footprint。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With globalization and global trade， suppliers carry more and more responsibility
    and so tapping。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into their cost base is central。 Even if this is not visible in the P&L statement
    of the manufacturing company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those costs matter。 Let's go back to our sub-way example one last time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d8e414833c53ee2a9f2e0164d0c4f680_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This time was an iron profits。 Profit is simply revenue minus cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's start understanding what the revenues here look like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Revenue is simply the number of sandwiches that we were making per hour， flow
    rate， times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the average price per sandwich。 Let's just assume we're selling these sandwiches
    for $6 per unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Say it takes us $2 in food costs to make a sandwich。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first item here that we have on the cost is we're spending the same 78
    units per。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hour times $2 per item in material costs。 We also have a labor cost。 We agreed
    on the labor costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We assume that we're paying these workers $12 per hour for all three workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also have some other forms of fixed costs。 And fixes are a whole topic in
    itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could talk about cost allocation and what drives these costs for long sessions
    by itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether it's rent， the insurance， the marketing， the overhead and what have
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's just say for now with some plausible cost allocation， we have $250 of
    fixed costs， per hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember， most of the business will be over the lunch hour and that is why I
    allocate so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much of the fixed costs to that one hour。 This allows us now to compute the
    profit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have the revenue minus the food cost minus the labor cost minus the fixed
    cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which gets us a profit of about $27 per hour。 So we're making about $27 per
    hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't want to comment whether there is a lot or a little。 For now， let's do
    something else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's think about some improvement strategies， which is something that we'll
    talk about in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the next video。 And let's just for the sake of argument imagine we could shave
    off some seconds of the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This could either be done by automating or by having a more skilled worker or
    by taking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of the 46 seconds and move them to the left and to the right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again more on how to find these improvements in the next videos。 For now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assume this number would go down to 43 seconds。 What's going to happen to profit？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clearly profit is going to go up。 The question is by how much？ Let's take a
    look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have $27 in the baseline scenario。 Three seconds faster at the bottleneck
    corresponds to an improvement of about 7% of the processing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time at the bottleneck and about 2% to 3% in labor content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Three seconds faster at the bottleneck is translating into a profit increase
    from $27。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: per hour to $48 per hour。 We almost doubled our profitability。 Wow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost doubling profits just because of shaving of a couple of three seconds
    at the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the key insight here to the value of improving productivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not just about cutting the cost of labor。 Poor productivity creates a real
    opportunity cost of not selling more sandwiches。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More productivity helps us to increase the top line and serve more customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d8e414833c53ee2a9f2e0164d0c4f680_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In today's video， we saw that the labor productivity is important for two reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First little things add up。 The example from the auto industry has reminded
    us is not just about the labor that happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in our process。 Our suppliers use labor to generate our inputs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our supplier has its own suppliers who also use labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you add up the labor costs to the value chain， the cost numbers become
    quite sizable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And second， we learned how labor can act as a constraint on the process that
    gets us back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the bottleneck。 The reason why we want to shave off a second or two at the
    bottleneck is not to save ourselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the associated labor costs。 Rather， we want to do this with the aim of generating
    some additional capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we are capacity constrained， more bottleneck capacity is worth a ton of money
    as it adds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to top line revenues。 And what is not to like about that？ In the coming video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we will talk more about process improvement strategies。 Until then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grab a sandwich and look for the bottleneck。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
