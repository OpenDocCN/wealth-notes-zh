- en: As I mentioned in the opening video， we need to be mindful of the time that
    is wasted。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: at resources， as well as the time it is wasted by our customers， by our flow
    unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today we will start looking at the time wasted at the resource。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would like to start this video with a medical story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A number of years ago my colleague Evan Feudson and I did a study in the ICU
    at the Children's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hospital of Philadelphia。 My research question was simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wanted to know what fraction of time an ICU bed was used to provide the care
    it can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and should provide and how much of the time was wasted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we were launching our study I felt reminded of Taylor's words， "waste of
    time， leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nothing tangible behind。"， How true？ Where would we go and find the data of
    wasted time？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like in any modern operation there was no shortage of data。 Medical records，
    billing records。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hospital IT systems， you name it。 But where would we find how much time was
    wasted？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our study of the ICU capacity at shop， here's what Evan and I did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We found a motivated student and that student would go to the ICU and go around
    the beds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: every hour， over and over again。 It's a really academic approach and I feel
    somewhat guilty of asking our students to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: spend so much time。 But I still think that this was the only way to get the
    job done。 Anyway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this approach allowed us to collect thousands of hours of our observations on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ICU beds and how they were used。 We then classified these hours as follows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here you see the hours that we have data for， the hours the students observed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then looked at the hours that from a medical perspective were not really
    needed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That included the hours the bed was staffed， meaning it had a nurse assigned
    to it， but the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bed was empty。 Hours the kid in the bed was waiting for a transfer and the hours
    that the bed was waiting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for cleaning or an incoming kid。 So in this case， we see that an ICU bed at
    shop at that point was basically used about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 82% of the time for the kid that it was designed to deliver。 That by the way
    is a really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really large number。 I show you the state of the two reasons。 First。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to introduce a new tool and then to discuss the limitations of the tool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this chart illustrates a method of really rigorously collecting data and
    analyzing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: value at time。 You map out the total time that you have available at the resource
    and then you subtract the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you're comfortable defining as waste。 We talk more about what exactly constitutes
    waste in the next video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For now， waste is the time that your feed is not adding value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not helping to get the kid healthy。 We then can define the overall equipment
    effectiveness or OEE for short。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: offer resource as a percentage， of time in which the available time of the resource
    is used productively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: either resource， is not waste in capacity。 We can do this for any type of a
    resource。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just for equipment。 You could do this for a machine， a factory worker， a
    lawyer or an airplane。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second， let me also be upfront about the limitations of the tool。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's go back to my ICU example。 When we collected the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we told the student that a kid in the bed that is on a ventilator， always should
    be in the ICU。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So any kid was observed in our study that was unevent was coded as value at
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think this was a plausible approach， but again， not without limitations。 Imagine，
    for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a kid being on the vent， but the vent really should have been disconnected，
    a couple of hours ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the care team was busy taking care of another kid and so the vent never
    got disconnected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or got disconnected six hours later。 And so you really have to ask yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are these six hours value at time or are they， not？ That gets me to the owner
    quote。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"moving is not working。"， I think this one is really deep。 Moving is not working。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means that even the dumbest consultant can look at a worker who is standing
    around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: idle and realize that that worker is not adding value。 To look at a busy worker，
    however。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: somebody who is working， somebody who is moving and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: determine how much of that work is really adding value， that is a lot harder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now according to owner， we can break up the time of workers that the workers
    are at work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into two buckets， work and waste。 Owner defines waste as needless waste of time
    and worker movements that should be eliminated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: immediately。 Again， more on this will come in the next video but for now， it's
    wasteful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Worker time minus waste gives us work。 But really not all workers adding value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Owner defines non-value at work as a work that was needed but it's not directly
    adding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: value to the customer。 Keep in mind this framework originates from a production
    setting but I think it's really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quite universal。 Every process has a custom so we can say that non-value at
    work in a processes work that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doesn't directly contribute to the willingness to pay from our customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such work might be needed but not adding value to the customer is oftentimes
    referred to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as incidental work。 For example， the person that was checking me in during my
    radiology visit and confirming。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that I would be indeed the person who was on the prescription， well that was
    not outright。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wasteful but we might imagine other ways to confirm my identity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And clearly from my willingness to pay perspective， that check-in didn't improve
    my health， my。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: happiness or my health outcome。 All right， back to OEE。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An OEE of 50% means that you can do twice as much work as you do right now with
    the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: amount of resources。 Or you can cut your resources in half and still serve the
    same number of customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if your capacity constrained， these productivity improvements will really
    add to top line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: revenues。 And if your demand constrained， they really guide you to the way to
    save an operating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cost。 To give you a non-health care example of this， consider the OEE of an
    airplane。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Airplanes are really expensive pieces of capital equipment as you want to get
    as much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: airtime out of an airplane as possible。 Here's an OEE chart for American Airlines
    Delos Fort Worth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every good consulting presentation that I've seen in operation says some version
    of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: slide somewhere in the deck。 So if you look at the 24 hours that are in a day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the plane is about one-third of the， time in the year。 It's pretty impressive
    by the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it's certainly much higher than what it was 20， years ago in the airline
    industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not to mention the situation and the summer of 2020 with the collapse of air
    travel that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've seen during COVID。 Now why is it？ What happens during the other time？
    So boarding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: de-plaining， maintenance， all of this stuff is clearly important， but it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not directly adding value。 It is the idea of incidental activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personally when I ran these numbers I was more surprised by the taxi time， but
    really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more than an hour and a half per day that $100 million airplane is basically
    acting as。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: a bus。 All of us are busy， which means we typically call for more resources。
    We want more staff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want more equipment， we want more office space， more and more and， more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the OEE framework reminds us that our first job in process improvement is
    to get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more out of our existing resources。 And OEE of 50% means that we can double
    our capacity without adding more resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The OEE framework is primarily there to help you organize data and the data
    collection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the front line。 It tells you what to look for as you're looking for process
    improvement opportunities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like any framework the framework is not right or wrong， it is up to you and
    your data collection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to decide what you make with it。 But it supports the spirit of Genshekin-Buzu。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go and see for yourself。 In the next video we'll talk about what to look for
    when you are at the front line looking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
