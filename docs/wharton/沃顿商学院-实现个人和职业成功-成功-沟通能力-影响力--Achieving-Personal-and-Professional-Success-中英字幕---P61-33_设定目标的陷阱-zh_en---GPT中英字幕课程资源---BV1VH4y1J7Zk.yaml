    2016。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They launched the great initiative， GR-8 initiative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    mortgage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they try to sell you other financial products。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we all know that goal setting can boost motivation and boost performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It motivates people to do more。 Here's the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What happens if you're struggling to hit that goal？ What then？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know psychologically it feels terrible to fail to meet a goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it presents a dilemma for employees or other people who are trying to hit
    a goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what often happens is that people will cut corners。 And in the case of Wells
    Fargo。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they opened 2 million fake accounts to meet these sales， goals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So employees were opening accounts with customers that customers had not authorized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wells Fargo ended up firing 5，300 employees， and they paid $185 million in fines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now one idea is to say， "Well， there's some bad apples here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's some bad employees doing the wrong thing。"， Five years， it's not the
    employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's the system。 And anytime you have to fire over 5，000 employees over the
    same problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not a few bad apples。 It's a problem that's more systemic。 And here it's
    goal setting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"We''re eliminating product sales， goals because we want to make certain our
    customers have full confidence。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our real estate bankers are always focused on the best interest of customers。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they're eliminating the goals because the goals were a problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this brings me to this idea of some work that we've done that we've titled，
    "Golls， Gone Wild。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '" because goals can do， in addition to very positive things， some negative
    things。'
  prefs: []

    that goal。
  prefs: []

- en: So think about a runner， they're trying to hit that goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're focused on hitting that time and they're ignoring the pain in their
    knees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe that's the right thing to do。 Maybe it's not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but goals focus attention in a way that can drive performance。 Goals can also
    increase risk taking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Goals can also lead to unethical behavior。 The Wells Fargo case is not an isolated
    case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many others。 So here's the idea about a narrow goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you could say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well they're trying to meet the goal but they're missing the broader， focus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the goal setting process narrowed their focus on 29% of market share。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But of course that's not really the goal。 The goal is to be profitable at the
    same time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    narrowed their， focus。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Health Commission reported that there were 400 deaths at Stafford。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hospital because they had excessive focus on certain targets。 So we see this
    across industries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across time， people end up narrowing their focus because， of goal setting that
    really does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by its inherent nature， focus people on specific targets。 Now risk taking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Staying also promotes greater risk taking。 In 2003， Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the large institution designed to support mortgages for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all Americans but particularly people with lower incomes。

- en: 14% of the mortgages were for low and very low income families。 2001 and 2003。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Loans that were so risky and so bad， they ended up filing for bankruptcy in
    a government。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bailout in 2008。 So here they set a goal and they ended up taking on more risk
    than they could handle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our own research， we've looked at goal setting and found that people are
    more likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to engage in risky and unethical behavior when they're pursuing a goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we've seen this in negotiation studies。 Pills goals are reaching less profitable
    agreements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're making larger demands。 And people have talked about the destructive
    goal pursuits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other domains too， like the 1996 Mount Everest disaster， as people were trying
    to reach their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goal of submitting the mountain， they took on too much risk and sometimes with
    disastrous。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    giant， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they want to make sure there are no insects along with those vegetables。

    around with them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in their pockets that they'd put into the vegetables so they could take them
    out later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    found the employees were actually shipping。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in a very narrow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sense。 Sears automotive in the 1990s， they set a goal for certain billable hours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They wanted $147 in billable sales per hour。 They found the staff overcharged

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In undercover investigations， they found that a vast number of Sears automotive
    employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were suggesting unnecessary work and it damaged the reputation for years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My own experiments with my colleagues have demonstrated that when people have
    specific。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: challenging goals and they fail to meet those goals， they'll often cheat， in
    this case they。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it turns out what she'd done is she had pushed goals on educators to produce
    these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: great achievement goals。 But when state investigators looked into this performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they determined that cheating， had occurred in more than half of the districts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over 180 teachers were implicated in this scandal that is teachers who were
    cheating on standardized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tests on behalf of the students to hit performance goals so they can meet these
    marks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can promote unethical behavior by guiding people to use unethical means

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So like Wells Fargo employees opening up accounts that customers didn't ask

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's it。 That's it。 It's the end。
