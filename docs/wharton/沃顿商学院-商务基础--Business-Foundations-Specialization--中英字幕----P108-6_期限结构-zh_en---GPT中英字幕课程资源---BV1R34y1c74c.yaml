    So。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    let's get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    reality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you， some examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: took not too long ago and you can see that as the term of the mortgage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    attention here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    the， interest rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to Yt that represents the yield curve those are the points on the yield curve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but that's the same as computing the discount rate for securities with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different maturities hence the link between discount rates and yields now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is a difference between discount rates and yields having to do with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: promise versus expected cash flows but that's a little bit outside the scope
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the course so let's leave that aside for now and in the context of treasuries
    yields。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that yield curves in other words interest rates they move around a lot or at
    least。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can and so to illustrate that fact I've plotted three yield curves here
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: purple one is from 2012 the blue one is from 2000 and the red one is from 1981。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you can see that the rate at which the government was borrowing has very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dramatically over time right today for short-term loans they're not paying any。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest the interest rates basically zero back in 1981 the interest rate was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around 15 percent the other thing I want to point out is that the the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relationship between the short end of the yield curve short-term interest rate
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long end of the yield curve long-term interest rates that can vary over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well here at least in 2012 we see that the curve is upward sloping so that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest rates short-term loans to the government are less costly than long-term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: loans whereas back in 1981 we see that long-term interest rates were actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: below shorter-term interest rates at least over a stretch here so it was it
    was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cheaper for the government to borrow at longer rates or over longer terms at
    least。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at a lower interest rate now this raises the question well what does this mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what does the what does the upward sloping curve in 2012 mean as opposed to
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: downward sloping curve in 1981 well there's a lot of academic debate about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that but one popular opinion is that the slope reflects expectations of future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest rates so when the yield curve is upward sloping as it is in 2012 this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: suggests that future interest rates are likely to be higher whereas back in
    1981。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this downward sloping portion also actually in 2000 it looks slightly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: downward sloping as well the downward sloping curve suggests that future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest rates are gonna be lower treasury yield curves what they're doing is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're graphing the relationship between interest rates on on risk-free loans
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: loan maturity so that they have a very special meaning when we talk about the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: risk-free rate we're really talking about the interest rate or the yield on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: treasuries but we can plot yield curves for a host of different securities and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's what I've done on this next slide is I've got three different yield curves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the blue curve is the yield curve for high quality corporate debt so you can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see that for what do I mean by high quality that's investment grade think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: triple B or higher so when high quality or highly credit rated firms were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: borrowing for say 29 years it's costing them about 5% per annum at least as
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: July 2014 whereas on the when they're borrowing short term say two years it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little over a percent the green curve is the yield curve from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: municipal bonds triple a rated municipal bonds as of July 2014 and then the
    red。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: curve is the treasury curve and what's sort of interesting to note is that the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: yields or the cost of borrowing was higher appears to be higher for the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: federal government over at least certain periods than it was for municipalities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is strange if you think that our federal government is is a much safer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bet than a municipality even a triple a rated municipality but what's going
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is mostly a tax differential as well as some liquidity issues all right
    so。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: what's the lesson here well look yields vary by maturity and risk so to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: illustrate that point I'm gonna look at corporate bond the yields on corporate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bonds and you can see as the ratings credit rating improves from triple B to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: triple A which is the best rating the yield goes down and I know drawing the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up arrow isn't helping but but the numbers are getting smaller and they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: getting smaller within each maturity bucket one to two two to five five to ten。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ten plus and that's a result of decreasing or credit risk right these are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are safer bond these are safe these are less safe but still relatively
    safe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the other thing to notice is that within a credit rating say triple A the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: yields or the interest rates are different now in this case they're。

    be。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rates well this present value formula that we've been working with is in many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's really an approximation for this now it's not such a bad approximation
    when。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is when the yield curve is say upward sloping severely or even downward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
