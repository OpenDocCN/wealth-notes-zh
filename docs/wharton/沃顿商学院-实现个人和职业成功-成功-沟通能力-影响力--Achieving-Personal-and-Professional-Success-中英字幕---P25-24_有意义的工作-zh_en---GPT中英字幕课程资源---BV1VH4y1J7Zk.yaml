- en: of success， I've been trying to find different ways to help you think about
    integrating or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combining the inner life and the outer life to find the happiness and satisfaction
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there may be available in certain kinds of achievement that would be well suited
    for， you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're doing things that you do well， you're doing things that excite you。 And
    on the other side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: noticing the energy and the sustenance that comes from happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and being able to sustain your motivation across longer periods of time to do
    things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that you do things exceptionally well。 So I want to zero in in this discussion
    about happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the inner life， the outer life， and come to some thoughts about actually careers，
    work， jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the usual way that people talk about work life issues now is as a balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's sort of like a seesaw with work on one side and life on the other and
    every time。

    attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to your family， then you have to give up some opportunities for promotion at
    work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so there's this trade-off going on。 Now that could be the case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's not necessarily the case because you can always think of different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways that you can put your work and life into a more harmonious relationship
    where they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really are two parts of a puzzle and when they fit together well， your life
    sustains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: So if this goal appeals to you， I think it's important to give some thought
    to what work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    solutions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the work and the life part that allowed them to have the inner life and the
    outer life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: working in tandem。 So some wonderful research by Swarthmore College is Barry
    Schwartz。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's a psychologist， part of the community that I interact with at the Penn
    Positive Psychology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Center。 He and colleagues basically defined different forms of work with three
    different definitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then they went out and did research and asked people what they thought they
    had and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the three categories were a job which is simply things you do for money to allow
    you to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other things that aren't the things you do for money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is what people do when they're supporting their family and getting paid
    nine to five。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on an hourly basis to do some work that they don't much enjoy but they do find
    dignity in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it and they are able to support their families so they have a job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A second way to think about work is to have a career。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now career is different than a job because a career suggests that you have a
    sort of， ladder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we talked about the metaphor of the ladder， that you go through stages， you
    advance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with different promotions and salary increases along a track。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A career for a lawyer might be in a start as a young associate and then become
    a senior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: associate than a partner in a law firm or a senior lawyer in a company or at
    an institution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you have a career certainly that's part of my approach to work as I started
    at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work as an assistant professor。 I got tenure which was promoted to associate
    professor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wrote some articles and books and I became a full professor。 So that's what
    a career looks like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there's a third way to thinking about work that Barry Schwartz and his colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: identified and they called it a calling。 That's a sort of semi religious term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Catholic Church calls it a vocation and that's work that you do because
    it gives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your life a sense of purpose and meaning。 And it's funny but different careers
    lend themselves or different jobs lend themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to being callings。 Certainly religious work is often thought of as a calling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But oddly enough people who are artists often think of themselves as having
    a calling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who are chefs often think of themselves as doing work that amounts to
    a calling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That they are called to do something that they feel really gives their life
    enormous meaning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and enormous interest。 I've kind of changed the vocabulary a little bit and
    taken the religious piece out of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think of this third thing as something I call meaningful work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But here's an interesting finding of this research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They actually went into a place like a hospital and they gave questionnaires
    to the janitorial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: staff。 Even people at the same job level in the same institution thought of
    their jobs in all three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of these ways。 So some people had the job of janitor and it was a job and they
    were simply supporting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their family。 They had no interest in it beyond the paycheck。 Some people thought
    of it as a career。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They were in the janitorial work force but they were also in the union and they
    were hoping。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to become a shop steward and become a union official and said they were looking
    at the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: job as a stepping stone along a track that would take them to more responsibility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And some people thought even of a janitorial job in a hospital which you might
    not think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a calling。 Some people for religious reasons， for reasons that had to do
    with their own personal story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they had a child who had had cancer that had been cured on the very ward that
    they were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now working on to keep the ward in tidy order。 And they considered their jobs
    colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They considered them very meaningful and they approached it that way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the interesting insight is that it isn't the job that gives work meaning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the people who do the work who give the work meaning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So essentially any work can have meaning for the right person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a lot of it has to do with how that work fits into your life story， how
    that work fits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into the context of your beliefs and values。 Now a very important part of what
    we talked about are your success values and the more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can integrate your own authentic success values into the kind of work you
    do that allows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you to make a living。 The more your work life and your personal feelings of
    happiness and fulfillment will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: begin to coexist and overlap and feed each other in a very positive way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So important to ask yourself is this sort of current diagnostic which kind of
    work do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have right now？ Well， I think that's a great thing。 I think that's a great
    thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think that's a great thing。 I think that's a great thing。 I think that's a
    great thing。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I try to present my students with a model that I hope is useful。 I'm going to
    present it to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three circles that can intersect。 Circle number one is all those types
    of work that someone might pay you to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then circle number two， overlapping with circle number one a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is work that you're good at doing。 Then circle number three is work that actually
    cites you and inspires you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where those three circles overlap， the circle that is work that people will
    pay you for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the circle that is work that you're good at and have talents for and the circle
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gets you excited and inspires you， that's a sweet spot right in the middle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To the extent that on a given day or during a day of a given week。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you find yourself in that sweet spot。 I think you'll find that the energy you
    get from doing the work not only is energy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well spent， but you often feel at the end of a work day that you have more energy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than you did at the beginning because the work itself gives you energy。 When
    I'm teaching。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes I'll teach a three-hour class and it'll be about a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: subject that I'm really passionate about and we have a great class discussion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the students have all prepared and they're alive and awake and engaged。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of three hours， I have more energy at the end of that class than
    I do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or did at the beginning of the class。 I know that in those moments I have some
    meaningful work of my own。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the part of the research that I've done in success， I've tried to tease
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different ways that you can derive this sense of energy and excitement and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning from the work that you are doing or could do。 By the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the search for meaningful work doesn't have to be a search for a new job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The search for meaningful work can be the search for the meaning in the work
    you do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the highlighting of that， the crafting of it， the small adjustments you
    might be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: able to make to bring more excitement to the work that you're doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that can be every bit as productive as thinking that you're in some crisis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you have to throw everything out the window and go on a quest to find the
    perfect job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Believe me， there are no perfect jobs。 There are no perfect bosses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no perfect way to earn a living that I've found。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's always a matter of making the best of the situation to the extent that
    you've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: crafted it yourself and make it work for you。 So there's an acronym that I've
    found。 Perfect。
  prefs: []

    a middle。

    have that autonomy。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    else is the cook。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and someone else is adding ingredients and you don't even know what the final
    dish is going to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be control over social events that you're able to create that enlivenes
    everyone's life in the organization。
  prefs: []
