    name and address。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pay the registration fee， but also choose where you're going to sit at the GALA
    dinner。

- en: I hadn't seen that before， but apparently some conferences do ask for that because
    this is a screen that I saw on a colleague's computer a few years ago when I dropped
    by to say hello over lunch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She was registering for a conference and was having to choose which of these
    tables to see that at the dinner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it raises a question that is ubiquitous for us。
  prefs: []

- en: We have to decide who we affiliate with， who we spend time with。 It goes back
    to junior high days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sitting at the cafeteria， but it's a question that all of us face in one way
    or another pretty much every day。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's just walk through this as an example and I want you to consider what
    you would do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you were registering for this conference and you were facing this screen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're coming in and you have some tables to choose from， how are you going
    to decide？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are you even going to base it on？ How are you going to think about it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So some people when asked this question， look for their friends essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/624e7ae8e763e1ade90b724f1f92c816_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Look for people they know and they want to sit at a table with people they know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a very reasonable natural consideration。 Some people think about， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't want to sit at a table and then no one else comes and sits behind me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/624e7ae8e763e1ade90b724f1f92c816_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So I want to sit at a full table basically。 I don't want to be isolated。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What other considerations might you bring to this？ Some folks think， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who do I need to work with at this conference？ Who might I have some interest
    in talking to？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could not be a friend。 It might be someone of purely professional interest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me go get a chance to sit at the table。 It may be the only chance I had
    to talk to them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also reasonable。 Some ambitious people think， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let me sit with people who I don't know or aren't like me or I won't have a
    chance to visit with in any other situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is relatively rare but I do hear that response sometimes。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: How would you do this？ How would you decide？ In many ways what we're going to
    talk about in today's lecture is this kind of consideration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: '![](img/624e7ae8e763e1ade90b724f1f92c816_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Can we bring some structure to how we do that？ Can we bring some insight into
    the consequences of how we do it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of it will look like the decision on what you do here at the registration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One suggestion I would offer here and we talk about this when we talk about
    this exercise with our daytime students is what about serendipity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What about what would happen if you sat at the table with only one or two seats
    filled so that you're rolling the dice essentially on the next seven or eight
    people that come to sit at that table？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/624e7ae8e763e1ade90b724f1f92c816_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we know about the people that sit down after we sit at the table？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/624e7ae8e763e1ade90b724f1f92c816_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What do we know about the people who when they see our name they decide to sit
    at that table？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's risky。 We don't know for sure but we can be certain that on average those
    people chose to sit there for a reason。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They wanted to sit next to us。 It's interesting that when we're making these
    calculations we sometimes don't realize other people are making the calculations
    about us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might be in our best interest to actually expose ourselves to that serendipity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to expose ourselves to the possibility that someone else is going to sit down
    and offer us something entertainment or information that we wouldn't have had
    otherwise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's an idea we'll continue to play with over the course of the day but wanted
    to get it out there because it's not something that folks often think about when
    they make these kinds of decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
