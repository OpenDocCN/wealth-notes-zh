- en: So we've thought about some of the mechanics of comparisons， some of the good
    in comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05f5efdf2db2c1cd91cf34f874b51681_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and some of the bad in comparisons。 So the question I want to think about now
    is how do we find the right balance？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we know that comparisons can motivate us and that can be very constructive，
    but they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can also create resentment and make us perfectly miserable。 How do we find that
    balance？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to be motivated but satisfied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05f5efdf2db2c1cd91cf34f874b51681_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And here are some key rules。 One， we want to think about favorable comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is comparisons where we look down at， people that haven't accomplished
    quite as much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can do this， for example， by volunteering or helping out people in need。
    By doing that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it will make us happier。 So one way to make ourselves happier is to engage in
    these downward comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to think about is how unfavorable comparisons can motivate us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So just as we thought about with the Michigan Duke game being down by one at
    halftime， we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can be incredibly motivated by these comparisons， or the Sputnik example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these unfavorable comparisons， can push us to great efforts to new heights。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So favorable comparisons can make us happier。 Unreal ones can motivate us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they can both do things that aren't as good， like making， us dissatisfied
    or less motivated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can think about comparisons in the negotiation process where they both motivate
    us and influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how happy we are。 You can think， for example， in negotiation， you might have
    some targets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some aspiration， some where you're trying to hit。 And you can think about your
    reservation price that leads to be willing to accept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you have something up high that can motivate us and push us hard and something
    lower or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reservation price that can make us in comparison happy。 That is， in a negotiation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're not going to get everything we wanted most of the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to fall short of our target and we're likely to get something
    better than。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our alternative， what our reservation price is， and so we're going to end up
    somewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the middle。 Now it depends on what we focus。 If we focus people's attention
    on targets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for focus on that target， we're going to be， more motivated but less satisfied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we focus on our reservation price， we're going to be less motivated but more
    satisfied。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's exactly what happened。 So here in this study that Adam Glinsky and his
    colleagues ran。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people who focused on， targets ended up doing better than people who focused
    on their alternatives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their reservation， price， but people who focused on their target were less satisfied
    than people who focused。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on their reservation。 So here we can think about trying to use comparisons to
    our advantage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So during the negotiation process， we like to focus on our targets but then
    afterwards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we like to think about our reservation price and that can make us more satisfied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want the benefits of that higher motivation as well as the benefits of
    feeling more satisfied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that can involve shifting our attention。 So that's how we can think about
    comparisons in negotiations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's not just negotiations， it happens more broadly。 And here's another
    funny puzzle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we think about the benefit of graduating in a recession。 Now why should there
    be a benefit？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you graduate in a recession， it's actually harder to find a job and if you
    do find a job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's likely to be less highly compensated and actually people who have studied
    the effects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of graduate in a recession are long lasting。 So you end up with a lower starting
    salary and that follows you for a long time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what's the benefit？ Well it turns out people who find a job in a recession
    are actually much happier even。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: though they're making up to 15% less。 They're happier because of the comparison。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're happier because they actually got a job and they realize that many of
    their peers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ended up doing less well。 So here we can think about comparisons helping us
    make sense of a lot of unusual phenomenon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: both in negotiation and in a workplace and more broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are three key principles of social comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to think about three key things that help us find our balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first idea is that we want to think about comparisons that go in or out
    of order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now by in or out of order what I mean is is this the expected comparison outcome
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was anticipated？ So if we're competitors， what do we expect？ If we're siblings
    who's older？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we talked about David and Ed Miliband。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05f5efdf2db2c1cd91cf34f874b51681_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: David the older brother was bested by his younger brother。 Now in contrast think
    about the Kennedys。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here we have the Kennedys where these siblings were going in order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where the brothers collaborated because they were helping each other go from
    one step to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the next and they went from one step to the next completely in order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05f5efdf2db2c1cd91cf34f874b51681_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The same is true in tennis。 We think about one of the most dominant sibling
    pairs in tennis Serena and Venus Williams。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now more recently Serena has dominated on the tennis scene。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She's eclipsed her bigger sister but things went in order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was Venus the older sister that was dominant first and Serena even said that
    as she was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: growing up everything was about Venus that's how it was supposed to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there when Serena began to win and beat Venus she was going in order and
    even though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she now has a much more impressive record that going in order turns out to be
    very important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it's actually enabled them to be incredibly effective as doubles partners。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact they have one of the most impressive doubles partners records of all
    time where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05f5efdf2db2c1cd91cf34f874b51681_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: their record is 21 and 1 in women's doubles finals and they have three Olympic
    gold medals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to share。 So going in order is one of the key principles of making comparisons
    work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other key idea is providing opportunities to compete in the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one thing that's particularly painful about say the Olympics is that for
    many athletes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is their one chance。 For able， give it for example he lost out， he'd never
    won the gold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was not in that race and there wasn't another future opportunity for him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we have opportunities to compete in the future those comparisons are going
    to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: less intense。 The third key principle is to think about the perspective of other
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When good things happen to us we often are pretty happy and people will say
    oh I'm so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: happy for you you really deserve it they might or might not be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is they might be privately quite upset but we don't typically get to hear
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To suggest that these comparisons are really quite intense and it really is
    a phenomenon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that travels across culturally quite well。 I want to share Russian parable and
    as a lot of parables happen there's a man who finds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lamp， rubs it， a genie emerges and the genie says you can have any wish you
    want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But here's the twist。 In this case the genie says the twist is your neighbor
    gets double。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can have anything you want but your neighbor gets double。 Well the man
    paces back and forth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rubs his brow， thinks very deeply and hard about it， and finds it says ah I
    know what I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want you to poke out one of my eyes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05f5efdf2db2c1cd91cf34f874b51681_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Here we can see that the comparison process is so intense， it's so invidious
    that here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the person is so worried about having something good because the neighbor and
    comparison will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do even better。 And so to think about these comparisons it's important even
    when good things happen to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: us to recognize that others are going to make these comparisons and they might
    be less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: satisfied at least than they might appear hourly。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
