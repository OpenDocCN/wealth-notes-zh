 This is our final set of topics。 We began this course and journey together looking at your success values as you've inherited。

 them。 We did something called the Six Lives exercise。

 You've got a chance to choose six different vignettes which life was more or less successful。

 We talked about the sources of those values， your families， culture， and the problem of。

 separating yourself from those assumptions so that you can gain perspective and begin。

 to take control over the values that you're motivated by so that you can put them in front。

 of you and make choices about them。 We then looked at how to particularize and individualize your search for success。

 thinking， about your capabilities， thinking about the habits that you have acquired over the years。

 that allow you to get up when you fall， that allow you to process and get motivated by。

 dissatisfaction， by moments when you think you could improve。

 Then in the last session we talked about digging deeper into the two dimensions of success。

 the inner life， happiness and the outer life achievement and dug deeper into the actual。

 content of what those two aspects of our lives mean and how they can sometimes be disappointing。

 if you think about them in proper way but can help to have a clear understanding so you。

 know and how to interpret your own experience。 In this final session， this final set of sessions。

 we're going to be working toward how you， can take a measure of where you are now in your journey and begin charting out what lies。

 ahead， what are the next steps， what is the destination that you're shooting for， what。

 are the ways that you might begin making steps in that direction。

 So I think we're ready to get right to work。 I have another assessment。

 another little puzzle for you to solve。 So if you could take a look at the three by three matrix that is going to be on your。

 screen， I'm going to challenge you to take a look at those nine cells and decide where。

 you are on that three by three matrix where the vertical dimension is your achievement。

 and the horizontal dimension is your happiness and just take it right where you are right， now。

 Take this as a like New Year's Eve moment and you're trying to just assess what your current。

 life situation is。 Is your perception of your achievement level low， medium or high？

 Is your perception of your happiness level low， medium or high？

 And take a second and kind of put a dot on one of those nine cells。

 I've done this exercise with lots and lots of different people and come to some very interesting。

 conclusions based on their testimony as to why they've put a particular dot in a particular， cell。

 So I just want to talk you through how that works and what people are thinking when they。

 identify themselves in one of those for a second and then we'll push on。 Thank you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
