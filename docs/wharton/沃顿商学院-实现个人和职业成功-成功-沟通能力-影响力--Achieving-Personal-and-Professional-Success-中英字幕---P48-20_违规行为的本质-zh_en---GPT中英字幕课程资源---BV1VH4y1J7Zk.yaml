    office。

    David Letterman is as an entertainer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as a comic， and he maintains that form and this violation doesn't derail us

- en: Now in contrast， when Arthur Anderson accounting ran into trouble that turned
    out to be terminal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was a core violation。 They built a brand for integrity not just a lasting
    name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anderson accounting was finished。 That violation meant that companies could
    no longer go to Anderson for trusted verification。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of their accounting statements。 That's a core violation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think about when trust can be repaired and I want to argue that even serious
    violations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like with the Sosa family can be repaired but that requires serious work and
    a very carefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: crafted apology that requires both words and actions。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for Arthur Anderson accounting that's a core violation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For Martha Stewart that's a non-core violation。 For Spitzer it's a core violation
    that as we care about that integrity that was his。
  prefs: []

- en: brand that was his campaign it's a core violation he can't recover but for David
    Butterman it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a non-core violation。 Now more broadly we think about competence and benevolence
    or integrity violations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it's a competence violation we felt short that is we just didn't have the
    capability， to do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those violations people are more easily forgiven。 As we forgive people for falling
    short if they were trying but what we feel is if it。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Anderson accounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that shredding demonstrate some intentionality that's they were trying to cover
    things up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that cover up suggests that they actually had bad intentions and it's much harder
    to recover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from bad intentions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ee8f2110c142a5d7cc7c75ddb07d0ce9_47.png)'
