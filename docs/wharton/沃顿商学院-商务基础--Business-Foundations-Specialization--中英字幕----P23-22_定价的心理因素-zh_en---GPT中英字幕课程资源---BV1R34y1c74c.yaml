- en: understand psychological aspects of pricing as we make pricing decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Psychologists have studied pricing in great depth and there are many key findings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with the first one which is very popular。 That's nine price endings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In much of the US and many parts of the western world， you will see prices ending
    in either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nine or five。 And there are many experiments and studies that have been done
    to illustrate the effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of nine price endings。 So here is one。 This is a very popular study that was
    done many years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Price of margarine in a field experiment。 The regular price of margarine is
    83 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unit sales is 2817。 What the price in the field experiment to 63 cents， sales
    increased by 194%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a 20 cent reduction in price increased sales by nearly 200%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the next four cents which is going from 63 to 59 increased sales by over
    400%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is this study trying to say？ The first 20 cents， even though it was
    larger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: had a much lower impact on sales than the， next four cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the next four cents involved adding the price at 59 cents which is a nine
    ending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is an example of a nine ending being effective in terms of increasing
    sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is another interesting study that has been reported in journals which is
    in a catalog， setting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These researchers sent out in a catalog setting the same dress to different
    consumers but it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was priced differently depending on who received the product or who received
    the catalog。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In one case the price was set at $34 in the other case at $39 and in the third
    case at， $44。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you would expect is that the sales would be the highest at $34。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because it's the lowest price。 What did this study find？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That the sales were higher at $39 as compared to $34。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One would expect sales at $39 to be higher than sales at $44 because 39 is lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then you would have expected the sales to go up at 34 because 34 is lower
    than 39。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But somehow the nine ending is perceived as a sale。 So sales were highest at
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these two studies illustrate why nine endings often lead to higher sales
    than non-nine endings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also case that there are many studies that have not found this effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the practice continues because there is not much evidence to change this
    practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we still continue to use nine endings and five endings especially in the
    United States。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another very interesting psychological finding when it comes to price is we
    often refer to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as the Weber-Fecner law。 I would put the word law in quotes because this is
    really not Newton's law or Charles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: law that we see in physics is more of an empirical generalization based on many
    studies put together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what did these two researchers find？ What they found was consumers reacted
    to prices more in percentage terms as opposed to absolutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in simple words what does that mean？ What that means is a typical consumer
    will be happy to drive five miles to say five dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a product costing ten dollars。 But the same consumer will not be happy to
    drive the same five miles to say five dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a thousand dollar product。 Now if a consumer rational if you are willing
    to drive five miles to say five dollars it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should not matter whether the product is ten dollars or product is a thousand
    dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we find empirically is that consumers are reacting more to a percentage
    price change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as opposed to an absolute price change。 And you all you can look in your heart
    whether you will be consistent with the consumers in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this study will you also be driving more likely to drive five miles to say five
    dollars in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a ten dollar product versus five dollars in a thousand dollar product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My sense is most of you will be consistent with what the subject in this study
    did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another very interesting effect that psychologists have found and is labeled
    as what we call。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as endowment effects。 It's a big word for something simple which is a sense
    of ownership increases the customer's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: willingness to pay。 I have often conducted this experiment in my class many
    times and it's just very simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I asked the students a very simple question I put them in this hypothetical
    setting that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: end of the course I will be distributing mugs and to one group of students I
    tell them you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are fortunate enough to get the mug at what price will you be willing to sell
    it to someone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who was less fortunate than you。 And to the other group I tell them you were
    not fortunate you didn't get the mug。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I ask each of these groups a what will you be willing to sell the mug at
    that's the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first group and the second group I ask them at what price what price will you
    be willing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pay for the mug。 And consistently what I find is that those who were put
    in the hypothetical situation that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they own the mug are asking more for the mug than those who are willing to pay
    willing to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: buy the mug。 Even though both groups are told that the list price of the mug
    is 750。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is also important here is to know that neither one of them actually has
    the mug they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are just put made to assume that either they have the mug or don't have the
    mug。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So endowment effects don't rely on actual ownership but a perception of ownership。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what are the implications the implications for this is make consumers feel
    they own the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product before they buy。 So if you look at car test drives many years ago if
    you went for a car test test driving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a car the usually the salesperson actually sat down with you and then was there
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you all the time when you test drove the car。 These days when you test drive
    a car they just take your driver's license in many settings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even though it's an expensive car they let you and your spouse drive the car
    on their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: own you just bring it back they know that you have to collect your driver's
    license anyway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what's the benefit？ A) they don't have the salesperson doesn't have to spend
    time but B) most importantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is you are in the car yourself without the presence of anyone it creates a sense
    of ownership。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and if the belief is that if you can create a sense of ownership people will
    be willing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pay more for the car or and therefore are more likely to buy it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another very interesting and powerful effect that psychologists have found is
    what we call。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as reference prices。 Most of us do not look at a price in isolation we compare
    it with some reference price we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have in our mind and ask ourselves is the price we are going to pay today better
    or worse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than that some reference price we have in our mind and most of the time these
    reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: prices are based on the past history of prices。 So if I have seen higher prices
    in the past and today I am seeing a lower price I have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a reference price in mind I compare today's price with that price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now how do you manipulate reference price one way you can manipulate reference
    price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or increase it is by comparing your today's price against a list price or oftentimes
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will see in an infomercial people will start with a very high price to create
    that as the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reference price and then slowly go down to make it sound like a deal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A very interesting effect that psychologists have found in terms of pricing
    is what they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: call as context effects。 What it really means is what is the impact of the choice
    set that is offered to a consumer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on their mind decisions。 So look at two possible settings we have in one setting
    consumers go to a store and they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see two cameras on the shelf。 One price at 169 and the other price at 239。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think of another set of consumers who go to a store where they see three cameras
    on the， shelf。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One price at 169 other at 239 which is the same as the other consumers but one
    price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much higher say at 469。 What do you observe in these cases？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you observe in these studies in a very robust way is that when you add
    the higher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: priced option consumers are more likely to gravitate towards the intermediate
    option。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normally what you would expect is if I added a camera that is costing 469 much
    of its sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will come from the camera that was costing 239 as opposed to the camera that
    was costing， 269。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you actually find is the higher price camera draws more from the lower
    price camera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in fact oftentimes boost the sales of the intermediate option。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in this case what you are seeing is something that you would not expect in
    a pure rational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: setting but we see this many times and this is really the foundation of what
    we call as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies offering good better best strategy。 What do you mean by good better
    best？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of offering just two versions of a product good and better offer three
    versions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the product good better and best and more people are likely to buy the better
    version。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is the middle version than the highest or the lowest version。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we reflect back on our module on pricing what do we conclude？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Effective pricing captures value and leaves as little as possible on the table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not that hard to get that extra 1% once we know how to do these things
    better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Price sensitivity is a major input into your pricing decisions and we learnt
    in this module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the drivers of price sensitivity and we also learnt how to actually
    measure price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sensitivity and price elasticity。 I think it's also important to keep in mind
    that consumers are not purely rational and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: incorporating psychological effects into your pricing decisions can also improve
    profitability。
