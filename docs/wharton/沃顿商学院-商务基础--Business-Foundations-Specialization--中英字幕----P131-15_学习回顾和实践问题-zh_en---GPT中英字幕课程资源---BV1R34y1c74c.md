Let's start today's video with some historical context about the Toyota production system。

![](img/5a7d7bfd7b8b43ded7b211476883367b_1.png)

and thus the automotive industry。 I should have said this before and I'm sure you have noticed this by now。

but I use it， to a more lean operation and to the Toyota production system interchangeably。

That doesn't mean that I tried to set you to your company， it simply points to Toyota。

success of developing a really powerful management system。 And more on that in a moment。

but for now， let me start with a question。 As a good German， I have to ask you this question。

Do you know in which country the first car was designed and built？ You guessed it。

The first vehicle was built in Germany by a gentleman with the name of Karl Benz。 In 1886。

Karl Benz， you see a picture of Karl Benz here， built the first automotive， vehicle。

the Benz-Pattent Motor Vog。 Benz was a real engineer who was passionate about the car at that time。

my hypothesis， is that he didn't care much about cycle time， idle time and line balance。

It was all about making one beautiful car。 The story about Karl Benz wouldn't be complete without talking about his wife。

Berta。 Berta was actually the first driver。 She drove from Manheim， where I went to college。

to Fort Simon back， a 66-month drive each way。 Legend has that she ran out of gas on the way and for obvious reasons。

there weren't， any gas stations to refuel。 So smart as Berta was。

she went into the local pharmacy to get enough fuel to get back home， to Manheim。

The second part of the automotive story I want to share is about Henry Ford。

While Karl Benz was a master of the product， I would say Henry Ford was a master of the， process。

He had his epiphany for how to organize car production from visiting slaughterhouses。

And slaughterhouses meet his hanging from conveyor belts and has moved from one worker。

to the other。 So good old Henry had the idea that something like that based on a moving line should work。

in an assembly operation。 So Ford really perfected in a very Tayloristic mindset the production of cars。

He managed to bring the time that it took to build a car down from 12 hours to 2。5 hours。

Every light heavily on specialization， each worker would only be doing a very small job。

like 60 seconds and less of work per car which allowed Ford to take cheap immigrant。

labor off the streets and take them to quickly build up his production capacity。

And so already 100 years ago Ford was making well over a million vehicles per year。

The most famous vehicle was a model T of which he had built 10 million units by 1924。

He was really playing a game of scale economies。 As Ford increased production he was going down the learning curve and was squeezing the cost。

and the waste out of the system that made the car affordable for the American middle class。

which led to a period of prosperity and widespread adoption of the automotive vehicle。

The Toyota story is very different。 Toyota was initially a company making automated looms。

They went into the automotive industry just prior to World War II。

In 1937 they founded Toyota Motor Company。 And as we know there was a very difficult time for world history。

We the Germans joined by the Japanese started World War II。

At the end of the war after 1945 the world lay in roots。

And just like the US through the Marshall Plan helped rebuild the German economy the US tried。

to help the Japanese economy。 And that helped included the attempt to establish an automotive industry。

So what the American citizens took tools and experts from Detroit and transplanted them。

over to Japan including to Toyota。 But they didn't go very well。

And one of the reasons why this didn't work was that post World War II Japan had little。

domestic purchasing power。 They transcended into not having the demand。

the scale that was so characteristic for the， US market before。 That spelt problems。

For example in 1950 Toyota made a grand total of 300 vehicles。 They almost went bankrupt。

Big prices， worker strikes。 It was really in that period of distress that the folks came together heavily involved。

was this gentleman we talked about earlier on Tai Chi or no。

![](img/5a7d7bfd7b8b43ded7b211476883367b_3.png)

And they started building what we now refer to as a Toyota production system。

I reviewed the Toyota production system in a moment but to give you a sense of the impact。

that the Toyota production system had on industry considered one last piece of data。

In 1986 there was a big report published out of MIT from an institute called the International。

Motor Vehicle Program。 A group of researchers went around the world benchmarking automotive plants comparing their。

productivity levels。 You see here the type of metrics that we discuss in this course。

Gross assembly hours per car for example。 I think of as labor content。

At the time a GM plant would have 40 hours of labor in a vehicle， a Toyota plant would have， 18。

Defects 130 to 45。 Most extreme inventories。 Remember how we talked about days of supply and inventory turns？

Two weeks worth of parts in a GM plant？ Two hours at Toyota。

That meant that Toyota would turn the inventory multiple times in a day。

And that was really the time when the world realized wow。

There is just a smarter way of building a car。 The lead author of this research study。

a gentleman by the name of Jim Wumec， coined， then the term lean operations。

So again lean and Toyota have since emerged as synonyms。

I have not done any automotive work in the United States but I did research with a German。

and a French car manufacturer and both of those willingly admitted that they had embraced。

the Toyota production system。 So what is the Toyota production system？

There are many ways to visualize this but I think the most common form of summarizing。

and synthesizing the Toyota production system is in the shape of a house。

There is a roof and at the top of the roof is the idea of zero waste。

The cool thing with the Toyota production system is you can impress people at cocktail。

parties with 5 or 6 words of Japanese。 So the Japanese term for waste is "muda"。

So zero waste is the top goal。 Second waste people often times refer to four other zeros。

zero defects， zero breakdowns， zero inventory and zero setup times。

Very much in the spirit of the seven sources of waste that we have discussed earlier on。

in this module。 And then the main part of the house consists of two big pieces。

There is a flowpiece and there is a quality piece。

The flowpiece is all about matching supply with demand and avoiding inventory by delivering。

just in time。 This includes things such as mixed model production。

flows piece at the rate of demand。 Remember we talked about tech time。

we talked about single units flow， we talked about push， and pull and we talked about come back。

Again lots of things that are really popping up throughout this course。

They are really all about the idea of flow。 And then there is a piece about quality。

Quality management has many elements to it。 One big idea is really making sure that you catch defects as quickly as you can。

And when we talk about quality in the quality module of this course， we'll go back to this， idea。

As we will see to your work as I empower to stop the line whenever there is a problem。

by pulling something that we will refer to as the unknown core。 Finally the house has a foundation。

Depending on which book you read or which expert you ask the foundations vary a little， bit。

I like to think about flexibility， standardization of work and work involvement。

Work and work involvement includes a famous idea of Kaizen。

I mentioned in passing earlier on in this module， the eighth source of waste， the intellect。

of the workforce should not be wasted。 And so Kaizen is all about involving the workforce in quality improvement circles and。

continuous improvement efforts。 Standardization of work is related to many of the seven sources of waste。

We make sure to standardize the one best way as opposed to having unnecessary motions。

And then really this idea of flexibility。 The ability that I can change over a machine from one type of car to another。

Or I have a worker who is trained to do multiple things。

This allows me to use a worker for multiple things， which makes it easier to balance the， line。

Okay， I know I'm out of time for this video as I did not manage to balance video duration， as well。

So let me quickly summarize the learning objectives for this module。

You see here the definitions related to the Toyota production system。

So there are really two simple formulas， the OEE and the flow time efficiency。

So let's take a moment to practice those， one practice problem for each of those two formulas。

Take a look at this first practice problem here about the cyclist and the wind tunnel。

Put me on hold until you've figured out the solution and then press play again。 Alright， here we go。

So we start by writing down the definition of the OEE。

The OEE is simply the value at time and we're going to divide this by the total time over。

the total time we pay the resource。 I suggest we're going to use a 10 day window here for reasons that will become clear in。

just a moment。 So 10 days and 10 days they are 24 hours in a day and 16 minutes in an hour。

So here in the denominator we have the total number of minutes over those 10 days。

Now we have to look at when does work not happen， right？ What do we have to take out？

From these 10 days they were only 9 days that we were actually working， right？

So 9 days when work gets done。 And then from these 120 minutes from these 2 hours 20 minutes are not adding value。

So the procedures are each 100 minute long in terms of their value at time。

And how many procedures are we doing per day？ Well we only have 5 value at procedures a day because the other two are not adding value。

their form of rework。 And then type this into your calculator and you get an OEE of 0。3125。

Alright the next problem is about the percent value at time looking now from the perspective。

of the flow unit。 As usual put me on hold first。 Here we go again。

Let's tackle this problem together。 So again this problem is about the percentage value at time。

And then that ratio is the ratio of the value at time。

And we're going to divide that value at time by the flow time， right？

How long the unit spans in the process。 Let's start with the flow time。

That is the time that it takes the country to renew the passport。 That is the 2 days。

the 4 days and then down here another 3 days， another 2 days， 10 days。

for the printing and finally another 2 days。 We add all of this up and it's going to take 23 days。

And how much value at work it's done over those 23 days？

Well we can debate a little bit about the 10 minutes that is happening at the clerk but。

it's a such a small number it would not matter。 Let's give them credit for these 10 minutes。

And then there are 2 minutes for the printing though that's a grand total of 12 minutes。

of value at time。 And you divide it by the flow time and you get 0。00 something。

So matter what it is， it is a very small number。

![](img/5a7d7bfd7b8b43ded7b211476883367b_5.png)

Alright that was a long video and a long module。 I hope I did not digress too much into the details of the automotive industry。

In the spirit of lean， then maybe a quick year in my closing comments。

Thank you for joining me in this module。 I see you soon。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
