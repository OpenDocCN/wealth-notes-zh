- en: So in this section， I want to spend a little time with the framework that I
    just introduced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I can show you what an effective tool it is for planning marketing strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And for facilitating conversation within your company about different assumptions
    people have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's go back to what the framework said。 As you recall， there were three
    dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was the operational excellent dimension。 There was performance superiority
    dimension。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there was customer intimacy dimension。 So the first thing you do in using
    this framework is to think within your industry for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your product and your firm， what does it mean to be operational excellent？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically these are things like customer service， reliability， cost considerations，
    delivery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory control， those kinds of things。 But what's important here is that
    you determine what operational excellence means in your industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you define that access in terms of what your customers think， your competition
    thinks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you think determines that access。 Similarly with performance superiority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does it mean to have the superior performance in your industry？ Financial
    service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's about the performance of stocks or， instruments， financial instruments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be product design， it could be style， it could be technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever it means to be product superior or performance superiority， that's
    what goes on this axis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's what this axis is。 And this axis is customer intimacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which means you're delivering what the customer wants。 It's about customization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: delivering to what a unique aspects that a customer demands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what it means to be truly customer intimate， this is something that P。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fader is going to discuss in the next section。 But think about what does it
    mean to be customer intimate in your industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the first thing to do。 Agree on what these dimensions stand for in your
    industry for your product or service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second thing to do is to determine what fair value is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fair value is the expectation that the customer has on each of these dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you must meet fair value。 If you're below fair value， customers reject you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you've got to be at least at fair value。 What the framework suggests is that
    you're going to meet fair value on two dimensions and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be the best on one。 But first you have to determine what are those customer
    expectations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these customer expectations change over time， they're not static。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They change as customer expectations escalate。 So just to give you an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's talk about what would happen in a brand new industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a brand new product enters the market。 As an example， let's think about
    Apple's iPad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when they introduce that product， it kind of changed everybody's expectations
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what a tablet should be。 When you have a brand new market and they're nothing
    existed before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers' expectations， are at the origin。 They don't have any expectations
    because the product doesn't exist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a new product comes into the marketplace， it tends to enter with a new
    product feature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so when the iPad came in， it came in with a new feature， the product features
    of that， iPad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that became better than what people expected and Apple was wildly successful。
    Over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people started to expect that。 A tablet had to have at least those features
    and that became the new fair value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there was pressure on Apple to come up with new features and they came up
    with the， iPad Mini。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They came up with a smaller size screen， a better resolution on the screen，
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kinds of things that would exceed those expectations。 But over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those new features will become the new expectations。 And you can imagine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as the product gets more and more mature， the fair value or the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expectations can go far out。 If you're in a very mature product category。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer expectations are quite high。 If you want to enter a mature category。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you really have to deliver products that meet very， high customer expectations。
    In most markets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if the expectations of product features become so high that it's very hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to differentiate and be a leader on that。 Many times what you tend to see is
    movement on the operational act。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people will deliver those benefits at a cheaper price。 And over time， in
    mature industries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these， the competition here， gets very high。 For very efficient， low costs and
    personal computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example， the features are quite， high and the price is driven down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you see very high expectations on both the operational and the performance
    superiority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dimensions。 It tends to be in mature markets that operational excellence is
    high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: performance superiority， is high， but the customer intimacy line is not as high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this tends to be what you'll see in mature product markets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you can imagine lots of different scenarios。 For example， in services， personal
    services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might have very high expectations on customer， intimacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You expect your hairdresser to cater the hairstyle that they give you to you
    so it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very personalized。 It may be that they use state of the art products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but perhaps they're not very good at operational， excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you might see in some market like that， very high expectations on customer
    intimacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very high expectations on performance superiority， but not as high in operational
    excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The point here is you determine what are these axes and what are customer expectations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for fair value on each of these axes。 This is actually the hardest part of this
    framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: determining what fair value is。 You can do market research on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can kind of predict it based on your experience in the industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people use the average of all competition to plot this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes fair value is at the minimum and all the firms are above fair value
    on some， dimension。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other times fair value or customer expectations are higher than any firm can
    deliver to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， in the airline industry， I would argue customer expectations
    are for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 100% on time landings and on time takeoffs， but no firm commits to that or can
    perform。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to that level。 So in that case， operational excellence might be higher than
    any firm is delivering to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the first step in this framework。 Determine the axes and determine
    where you are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where your fair value mark is on each， of these axes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the next thing you do is you plot how your firm is delivering to fair value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's just for the sake of argument， assume fair value in this industry is
    here and is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here and is here。 So then I either do market research or discuss it and try
    to get some kind of managerial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: insight on where my company is on these different dimensions relative to fair
    value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it may be that below fair value on performance superiority， maybe I'm above
    fair value on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: operational excellence and I'm kind of hitting the relatively low expectations
    on customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: intimacy。 So that's the next thing。 Where is your firm？ In you plot， where's
    the competition？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So perhaps the competition is way below you in operational excellence but above
    you in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: performance superiority and also hits the spot on customer intimacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you're ready to plan strategy。 And what you want to do with this case is
    plan short term strategy and long term strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the short term， what you have to do is if you remember what the framework
    says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it says you have to meet fair value on two dimensions and be the best on one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I was the red firm， what I might argue my short term strategy would be
    is to get up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to speed on performance superiority because I'm below。 And if I don't keep up
    with my product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I might ultimately be， you know， be shaken out， of the market。 And so in the
    short term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I might plan strategies to improve my performance superiority。 In the long term，
    perhaps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to be known as the market leader in operational excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I need to do what it's going to take to keep that operational excellence
    leadership。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and become like a Walmart or a Vanguard that's known for being the best at operational
    excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's just one example of the kind of strategy you can plan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what's great about this framework is it forces everybody to identify their
    assumptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to map in a very complex market what matters to the customer， where customer
    expectations， are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where you think the competition is delivering， and where you as a firm are strong
    and weak。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it puts it right on one framework。 Now this framework can be used very systematically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can run market research studies to actually plot where you and your competition
    and customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expectations are。 The other thing to remember is fair value is not a static
    concept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These things change over time。 So you need to map this over time to see where
    customer expectations are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing that happens and you have to think about this as a dynamic strategy
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you make a move， competition reacts。 They're not just standing still。 So
    you need to think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well， if I move here or if I move there， what's competition going， to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it gives you a way to plan those kind of moves over time。 And lastly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you think about how costly it is to move up with these different kinds of， things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that might affect your strategy。 Because it's very， very costly to move
    along this product axis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you may think about whether or not that's the right short term strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe that's something you're going to do in the long term because you have
    to invest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more to be able to move here effectively。 The other thing you need to consider
    when you think about all of this is that these dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are not independent。 If I move along the product dimension here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to change my cost position。 I'm going to change my efficiency。 So
    as I move here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I might be lowering my operational excellence。 And similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as I become more product featured or product focused to deliver to technology，
    and design。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I may become less customer intimate。 And so you have to think about the interactions
    of all these things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what's very， very nice about this framework is that it's clear and simple
    and it maps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a very direct way some of the intricacies and complexities of your marketplace，
    of your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: firm and of your competition。 And for that， it's a very， very effective planning
    tool。 [MUSIC]。
