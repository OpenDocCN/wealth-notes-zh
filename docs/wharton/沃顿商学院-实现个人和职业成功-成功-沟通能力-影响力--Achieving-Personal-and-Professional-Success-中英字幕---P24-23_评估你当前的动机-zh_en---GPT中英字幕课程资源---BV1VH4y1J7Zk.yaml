- en: in this whole course， one of the things that's very important that we haven't
    talked about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: yet is assessing the kind of motivation that is primarily driving you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there are two kinds of motivation that people usually talk about which is
    intrinsic， motivation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing things just because you love doing them and not for any kind of reward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and extrinsic motivation which is doing things primarily for a reward and whether
    you like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them or not is sort of indifferent。 My own feeling is that those two generally
    mix。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everybody has some level of intrinsic， motivation and extrinsic motivation that
    is getting them going on whatever their projects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tends to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your children。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you kind of process in the ordinary way of getting a paycheck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I'd like to talk about one other cut on motivation that I think is most
    intimately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: related to your success concept and that is to ask a question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of your situation now and we just looked at the matrix to help you
    assess that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do you feel like you're more running toward your goals at this point or do you
    think you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more running away from your fears？ The two dominant drivers in the human psyche
    are desire and fear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even a snail will move forward to get food with desire but withdraw into its
    shell if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it feels threatened and has fear。 So humans have the same two principal motivations
    and I think it's important for you to assess。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which of these and in what mixture you're currently working on your success
    goals with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because if fear is an issue and sometimes when I ask this question to students，
    they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: almost look startled because although they've been thinking that they've been
    moving toward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the goal of say graduation， what they realize is they've just， they've been
    motivated almost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as much by the fear of disappointing their families or the fear of failure if
    they don't， graduate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And to the extent that you've got these backwards and you're motivated more
    from fear than you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are from the desire to achieve something， the chances are that it's going to
    be a much more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: haunting sense of success， a much less satisfying sense of success because all
    you're going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to do is keep your fear at bay and you're not going to feel the fulfillment
    of having。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually grasped something that you were pursuing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's important to get this oriented in your mind。 We have many fears。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can be motivated by simply a fear being alone or a fear of being a failure
    or fear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of being not taken seriously or being unimportant or disrespected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those fears are dominating your life。 I think it's really important to stop
    and turn and face them and try to identify them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a half steps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The desire part doesn't have the freedom to exercise all the skills and talents
    that you， have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And underlying all fears in my view is one really big fear that all humans face
    and it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a big mystery and essentially it's the fear of death。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think it's important that everyone at some point come to terms with this
    important， fear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is sort of fundamental to the human question。 I once did a calculation and
    basically if you're lucky enough to be 90 years old and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're 90 years of filled with days of full awareness， you will live for 32，850
    days， 32，850， days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's all you're going to get in this life。 Now if you believe in an afterlife。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then there's another plane of existence and something， else will happen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's still the case that 90 years gives you 32，850 days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think it's important to understand that your time is limited and that
    you have to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accept that as one of the constraints that you're living with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people come to terms with their fear of death because they lose a loved
    one and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have the experience of losing them and they sort of become profoundly aware
    of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fact that they themselves may or will someday face this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Others come to it because they have some personal experience of their own mortality。
    For myself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was on a world journey of trying to find myself after college and seeking
    some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sort of wisdom that would allow me to figure out how to put my life back together
    again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the wake of my crisis with my family and the Vietnam War and my separation
    from their， values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I was living in a Buddhist monastery in Sri Lanka and I was under the tutelage
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a wonderful Sri Lankan teacher。 We meditated pro pretty much from six in the
    morning till about nine at night。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was an hour of sitting meditation and a half an hour of walking meditation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We only had two meals a day， breakfast and lunch and then no more food until
    the next， morning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And being a Westerner and not having grown up in Asia， I had a terrible time
    sitting in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the posture that you have to sit in to meditate。 And so I was in a great pain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You only got to speak for about fifteen minutes a day and you spoke only to
    your teacher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I was finally at my wit's end one day and I went to my teacher Venerable
    Seavaly and， I said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Venerable Seavaly， I''m doing nothing in my meditation except being aware
    of pain。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My legs are in pain， my back is in pain， my feet are in pain and this can't
    be very meaningful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for me to be sitting hour after hour and nothing but pain is happening as far
    as my mental。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experience。"， And he looked very compassionately at me in a very wise sort of
    way and he said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"I think， it''s time for you to take a walk in the forest。"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so he gave me leave to forgo my meditation practice for the afternoon and
    there was a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: great big forest outside the back of the monastery in the Port of Sri Lanka
    where we were located。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I just took a walk in the forest and it was a remarkable experience for
    me because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was simply walking along wondering why the monk had sent me back there and
    then all of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a sudden I noticed that the whole forest floor was covered with dead leaves
    and then I noticed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that there was a dead bird under a tree and then I noticed that the soil was
    filled with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: insects and animals that were sort of basically reprocessing the forest floor
    from all this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: detrus of nature into something that would give rise to new life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it just hit me that I had been reading a book and that someone had just
    given me the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: key to translating it and that the book was the book of life and that the main
    message。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was that life and death were connected and had to be with one another in order
    for either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one to be。 And that hit me like a ton of bricks。 I sat down under a tree。 I
    wept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just realized that I would die just like everything in the forest and I just
    mourn the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fact that that was what lay ahead for me but it was a very cathartic kind of
    pain at that， point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I went back to my meditation and the truth is from there I marked that
    point in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my life as basically a turning of the page up until that point I think I had
    been running。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from a certain fear of death and after that day I understood it in a kind of
    visceral way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it meant I could confront the death of my parents with a very different
    perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It meant that I see suffering in a very different way my own and others and
    so it's been I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: noted for myself as a big turning point in my understanding of what life is
    and essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what success means。 I had a student who had confronted this very differently
    in her experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She once she's a very religious person。 She was an Orthodox Jewish woman and
    as a child when she was about ten years old she was jumping。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into a lake near her home and she said that she hit her head on a rock that
    was not far。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: below the surface and she felt herself drifting underwater down toward the bottom
    of the lake。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and she said as she drifted she felt a very warm， full， enormous presence surrounding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: her with love and that there was this embrace that she was conscious of and
    then the next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thing she remembers is she was on the shoreline next to the lake and there were
    people pushing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on her chest and shouting and they had located her and brought her back to the
    side of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pond and had brought her back to life and she said that this experience of almost
    dying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very personal， very intimate had completely eliminated for her the fear of death
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she now knew in her own experience that death was going to be something very
    different than。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she had expected and something much much more overwhelmingly positive for her。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So everything about her life had changed after that she， her concern for things
    like being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: alone or her concern for the death of a loved one that she of course felt compassion
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a sense of loss but not a sense of fear and I think that fundamentally changes
    how you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: approach the success that you want to achieve in your life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I guess I'd need to ask you where you stand with this big fear and if you
    have confronted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it then you've definitely overcome a major challenge that your life will hold
    for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're uncertain about it then I think it might be something that you want
    to look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at and try to understand more deeply don't be afraid of the fear of death。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's something that is a stage in your maturity， a stage in your growth and
    a stage in your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ability to help others。 So once you transition from running away from your fears
    then you have the opportunity to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: run with all of your energy toward the future and toward the goals that you
    want to achieve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I just have a quick exercise that I think might help you imagine that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We call it the lottery exercise。 It's inspired by a woman named Cynthia Stafford
    that I read about in my studies on success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cynthia Stafford was an office worker， or still is， she's alive still and she
    always played。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the lottery and she reported that over and over and over she would visualize
    this winning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lottery ticket that she imagined she was holding and she had this amazingly
    vivid picture in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: her head of the dress she was going to wear， the ticket and the number on it
    and everything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the situation when she won the lottery。 Then she played this number of
    course over and over and then lo and behold it was a California。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lottery she won and she won on a day when she was wearing the very dress that
    she had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imagined herself wearing and she ascribed it to a kind of miracle mind power
    that she。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just imagined that her mind had created this winning lottery ticket。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I think Cynthia's story is important because that's a kind of magical thinking
    that actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doesn't work because if you imagine that there are eight or ten million people
    playing the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lottery at least several thousand of them are imagining that they have the winning
    ticket。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the mere imagination of something is not likely to affect the lottery machine
    that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: punching out the tickets。 But what I admire about Cynthia Stafford is she had
    this experience it was a little spooky。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think for her but rather than turn it into some sort of motivational speaker
    career where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she went around trying to convince people that magic is what makes you win a
    lottery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She actually looked inside found what she was really passionate about took care
    of her。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: family first of course set up trust funds for her kids to go to college and
    you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: did some traveling。 But after that she became very passionately involved in
    theater she helped found some community。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: theater projects in Los Angeles she partnered with David Geffen a famous theater
    person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out there to start to get a program for disabled people and elderly people to
    come to the theater。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the weekends when they were free and she even started a television and movie
    production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company where she could make films and tell stories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so here's a person who won the lottery but turned it into her life streams
    and she。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: partnered with people that helped her become successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's your challenge imagine you've won the lottery maybe you weren't wearing
    the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: color dress or the same color suit that you imagined but you won the lottery
    anyway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what would you do with it？ Let's assume you would take care of your family
    let's assume you would travel to your heart's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: content but let's also assume that you now have the problem of figuring out
    what to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with all this opportunity and I think if you take a minute and dream a little
    and write。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: down what you would actually do we're money not a problem for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you'll find is that you'll get some directional signals maybe you would
    want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work in education maybe you would want to work in the media maybe you would
    want to provide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: educational opportunities for people in your community or work in developing
    country or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get involved with politics but if money were not the option what would you do
    and I think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that begins to sketch out the kinds of goals that are good goals that will be
    inspiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goals to run toward。 So I'm going to give you a final exercise as part of this
    sequence and I want you to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take it very seriously and it's going to have several steps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Step one I want you to write down four or five goals that you currently have
    for your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: life could be short-term goal long-term goal relationship goal career goal but
    any kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of goal you want it's up to you but write down four or five of them and pause
    this video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: while you do that and come back and I'll have your next instruction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So having written down the five four or five goals here's your next problem
    I want you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to circle the one that is the one that you have to achieve before you can achieve
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: others so which of those goals is essentially the precondition for you to achieve
    the others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you wrote down a goal that was become a college teacher or you know write
    college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: textbooks or something getting a graduate degree a PhD would be a first goal
    that you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have to achieve before you could achieve any of the others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe you wrote down something about a family and children finding a life partner
    would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be a goal that you would have to achieve before you could achieve any of those
    other goals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So note the goal that you have to achieve before you can achieve the others
    and then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: put a circle around it and then the final step of this is really simple at the
    bottom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: half of the page where you've written your goals write down two things that
    you can do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this week to take steps toward advancing on that goal you put a circle around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two things to concrete actions you can take today tomorrow Friday that would
    advance you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: toward that goal that you put a circle around that is the precondition for being
    successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in any of the other goals。 I think that's the kind of commitment that you need
    to make it's the humility that you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: need to have in order to get your life going in the direction that your own
    theory of success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: suggests that it should go。 I have a home in summer place kind of down in Virginia
    that I first encountered as a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: child and it's a place cabin it has four bedrooms in an outhouse no bathroom
    and it's on a river。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pass and there are lots and lots of stones in front of it with a rushing river
    that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going by and as I was a kid because my father bought it early in my life and
    then I've been。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going back ever since as a kid I used to have a game and I would try to see
    how far down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the river I could get on these stones that littered the river pass without getting
    my。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feet wet and see how many different ways you could do it and the river changed
    every time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it went up and down with the weather。 So these life goals are like the stones
    in the river you have to take action to get to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the next step and then once you're there you survey the situation and then decide
    what's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the next best jump you can make to keep your feet from getting too wet and get
    make progress。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the next step and then you get to the next step and then survey the situation
    again and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take action on the next option that you see is the best option。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So this is very concrete I think one of the things we're trying to do here is
    not just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: give you a theory of success but give you some tools and some motivation to
    take action。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
