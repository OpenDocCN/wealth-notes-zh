- en: Okay， so we've reviewed the product-centric approach to business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We understand that for most companies， again， those focusing on performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: priority or operational excellence， it's all about coming with that， blockbuster
    idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reducing a lot of it， keeping the cost down， and， using appropriate metrics
    for it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we call that product-centricity。 Now， we're going to start talking about
    some alternative approaches。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but， I don't want to suggest that product-centricity is doomed to fail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't want to suggest that all companies must move away from product-centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't want to suggest that that's a recipe for disaster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I do want to suggest that there are some aspects of product-centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that make it not quite as great as it used to be。 So as you can see on this
    slide over here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd like to say that there are some， cracks in product-centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's just a number of trends going on today， things that didn't really exist，
    say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 15 or 20 years ago， that make the product-centric approach just a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit less guaranteed successful than it was back then。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd like you to just take a minute or two to think about， what are some of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the changes today compared to 15 or 20 years ago that make product-centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just a little bit different that takes some of the shine off of it， that takes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of that automatic kaching away from being product-centric？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would be some of the emerging trends， most of which are trends that are，
    here to stay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that might make a company think twice about whether they want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: focus on product-centricity or start looking towards a different kind of， strategy？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take a moment and think about that， and then we'll run down a list of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of the leading factors that take some of the edge off of product-centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I bet first and foremost on everyone's list is the idea of commoditization。
    See。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back in the old days， it was so hard to come up with and manufacture a new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product or deliver a service that you would stay steps ahead of all of your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: competitors for a long period of time before they could come up with an equivalent，
    idea。 But today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because of technology， things commoditize much more quickly。 Product lifecycles
    are getting much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much shorter。 Companies know that as soon as they， launch something new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have to have the next new thing already in process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this idea of commoditization takes away some of the goodness of product-centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's a way of thinking about it。 In the product-centric world， every company
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: counting on some kind of natural monopoly。 We are doing something that's going
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: keep us ahead of all of our competitors for a long period of time。 And that's
    what's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to let us focus on developing the best or delivering the most efficient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But as those lifecycles shorten， as things commoditize， it takes away some of
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: natural monopoly power。 But that's just one reason。 It's a big one， but by no
    means， the only。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important reason would be changes on the customer side。 Our customers
    are so much smarter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more informed than ever before。 It used to be， that our customers were much
    more passive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They would take whatever products or， services that we would give them and they
    would say， "Oh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's great。 Terrific。 Thanks very much。 I'll figure out how to use it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '" But today''s customers are much， different than yesterday''s customers。 They''re
    much more informed。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're much， more demanding， and they're much savvier。 And again， a big reason
    for this is the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: internet， information technology。 Customers are so much more aware of options
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are available to them or options that might not yet be available to them， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they clamor for than they ever were before。 Again， the customers aren't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: passive like they used to be。 So smarter customers put much more demands on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies and make it harder for them to extract as much value out of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products and services that they deliver。 And a third way that technology makes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: life a little bit more difficult for product-centric companies is the idea that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products are now available everywhere instantaneously。 If you think about what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FedEx or DHL or UPS does， they take away some of that natural monopoly power
    that， a company had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the old days， companies would rely on the fact that no one else had， a product
    like them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But even if other companies did have a product like them， customers wouldn't
    be aware of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And even if customers were aware of it， customers wouldn't have access to it。
    But today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because distribution technology， brings everything， everywhere， overnight if
    you want it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's much harder to， protect yourself from other products and services that
    are available in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other regions。 So there's all kinds of ways that technology takes some of the
    edge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: off of product-centricity。 But by no means is it limited to technology。 Part
    of it is， a mindset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People are thinking globally much more than ever before。 So customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are much more actively looking for products and services from other regions
    than。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they ever were before。 And then there's the issue of deregulation。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: regulation was a way that gave companies monopoly power， that they were the
    only。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: game in town and customers had no choice。 But as one industry after another，
    deregulates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies need to be much more competitive and it's much harder to， stay a step
    ahead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in some cases， it's not deregulation， but it's， a re-regulation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's regulations that are making markets much more competitive。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's another reason why product-centricity just isn't what it used， to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A sixth reason comes back to the customer again。 Not only is the customer， smarter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but as I mentioned before， customers are far more demanding than they， ever
    were before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the old days， it was good enough just to let the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take a bunch of products and services and figure out what they're going to do，
    with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Figure out how those different products and services are going to help。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them solve the problems that they have。 Today's customer is much more demanding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's insisting that companies not only deliver them one product or service at
    a， time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but bundle together products and services， sometimes including products and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: services that the company might not make any money on。 It is now much more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imperative than ever was before for companies to be seen as a trusted advisor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be providing full-fledged solutions to the customer and not just piecemeal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products and services that the customer will figure out how to combine together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the great stories along these lines is that of IBM。 IBM， which of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stands for international business machines， used to be one of the ultimate，
    product-centric firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They were just the best at coming up with and developing， certain kinds of products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: business machines， computers and so on， better than， anybody else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But they had a revelation in the mid-1990s。 They could actually make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more money being a trusted advisor instead of saying， "Here， customer， buy our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine telling a customer what set of machines and services to be buying。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That they're actually higher margins， especially as computers and other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information technology equipment commoditizes。 They can actually do better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being a solution advisor。 And slowly but surely， as many of you know， IBM spun。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: off many of his business machines。 They no longer manufacture personal， computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their presence in most other hardware areas has diminished。 But。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where they're making their money today is from being a customer-centric solution，
    provider。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to the customer and saying， "Here are the set of products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and services you should be buying。" And that kind of expertise doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: commoditize nearly as much as any one product might。 And so that idea of moving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: away from just selling products to being a full-scale solution provider is a
    major。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: change in the last 15 to 20 years。 And there's one more point that I want to，
    talk about with you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's not necessarily the most important crack in， product centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's one that I like to think about a lot。 And that's the， data。 See。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: today's technology enables us to collect and manage and utilize data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about customers in a way that we just could have never imagined before。 So if
    you。

- en: think about old companies， think about Henry Ford， who was one of the real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: originators of product centric thinking， he had no idea how many customers he
    had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He didn't know whether he was selling one car to each of 10 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different people or whether he was selling 10 million cars to one person。 He，
    didn't know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And frankly， he didn't care that much because he was so product-centric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in his thinking that it was just a matter of turning that crank of pushing，
    products out the door。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of keeping the volumes up and keeping the costs down。 But， today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: given these other cracks in product centricity， it's much more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: important for companies to be using the data about their customers， to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understanding who's buying what and for how long and what other products that，
    they're buying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the information systems give us the possibility of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: developing business models that were unimaginable before， but could actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be more successful than the product-centric approach。 And I want to give you
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: couple of examples of that。 [MUSIC]。
