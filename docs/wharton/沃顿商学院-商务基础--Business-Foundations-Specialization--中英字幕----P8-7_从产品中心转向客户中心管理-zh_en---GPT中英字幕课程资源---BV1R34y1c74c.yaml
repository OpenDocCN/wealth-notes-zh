    of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative and I'm really excited to be starting
    my module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of our Introduction to Marketing course。 The fact that I run a research center
    called the Customer Analytics Initiative suggests。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that I'm a data guy and that's certainly true。 I love looking at data about
    customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trying to figure out which customer is doing what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and for how long and for how much money and what kinds of tactics can companies
    use to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: create and extract even more value from the customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for me it's all about the customer behavior， the patterns that we see over
    time and the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kinds of strategies that companies can build around those patterns in order
    to do better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for themselves。 So I want to start by going back to one of the frameworks that
    Barbara Kahn used in her。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: modules。 You might recall this slide over here where she laid out the basic
    kinds of strategies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that companies can follow。 And a couple of these strategies are really clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everyone understands what performance superiority means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just having the very best product out there。 So whether you're an Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a BMW or a luxury product like Louis Vuitton or a Gucci， you， want to have the
    best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Operational excellence is also pretty clear。 You want the lowest price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want the most efficient operation or the most efficient， experience for
    your customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So whether you're talking about a Walmart or an IKEA or a Zara， you're really
    interested。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in keeping the cost low， keeping the process very efficient。 That gives us operational
    excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's the third leg of this diagram that we're going to spend a lot of time
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the idea of customer intimacy。 And basic idea makes sense。 Let's focus
    on the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But exactly what does that mean？ Who is the customer？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are we going to focus on all customers the same way？ Just how intimate do we
    want to get？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how do we actually make more money on something that actually adds costs
    than some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of these other strategies？ So that's going to be the main focus of our efforts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's taking this idea of customer intimacy or， as I like to call it， customer
    centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and really understanding what it is， clarifying what it isn't， motivating why
    it's important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and trying to get firms to make a well-informed decision about whether they
    want to pursue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that kind of strategy and whether， when， and how to actually go after it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's going to be the focus of our work。 I'm here on South Street。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the popular shopping areas in Philadelphia， and all around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: me would be stores that represent the different kinds of strategies that Barbara
    spoke about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just over my right shoulder， you'll see one of my favorite pizza places。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's performance superiority。 Right down the block， there's a number of fast
    food restaurants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That would be operational excellence。 But what about customer intimacy？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What kinds of stores would really be customer intimate or customer centric，
    as I like to， say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what makes them different？ So let's really understand how these different
    strategies compare with each other and then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take the deeper plunge into customer centricity。 So give me a few minutes to
    review the traditional steps of running a business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Running a business in a performance superior or an operationally excellent kind
    of way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's going to give us the basic foundation so that we can really understand
    how customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: centricity is different， some of the challenges associated with it， and some
    of the opportunities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that customer centricity can provide that you might not be able to achieve with
    a performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: superiority or an operational excellence strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a step back and review these traditional steps of running a business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For most commercial enterprises， the overall objective， beyond everything else，
    beyond all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the tactics that a company is using and the strategy that it's hoping to follow，
    it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all about making money。 And again， Barbara reviewed this and you don't need
    to be told this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's all about maximizing the value of the whole corporation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's looking at the money that we make today， the money that we'll make tomorrow，
    the money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we'll make 10 years from now。 And when we recognize the time value of that
    money that today's dollars are more important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to us than tomorrow's dollars， when we take the discounted flow of the company's
    profits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that in theory gives us the overall value of the corporation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's our job as a manager to maximize the value of the corporation， which
    means maximizing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the net present value of profits that the company is bringing in。 So we agree
    on that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That part is pretty easy conceptually， but the question is how do companies
    achieve it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that takes us back to those core strategies that Barbara laid out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when you think about the most traditional among them， again， performance
    superiority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and operational excellence， it's all about coming up with a blockbuster product
    or service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coming up with a brilliant idea that puts a step ahead of all of our competition
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: figure out ways to bring that idea， that product or service to market。 So it's
    conceptualizing it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's developing it， it's manufacturing， distributing， marketing， that idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what business is traditionally all about。 And so the key for most firms
    to making money isn't only coming up with that idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but then， figuring out ways to produce lots and lots of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the things that we discovered over the years is that producing lots
    and lots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of quantities of this product or service that we want to deliver not only helps
    us make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: greater revenue， but the fact that we're producing and distributing so much
    of it also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: brings our costs down。 So the core focus of most traditional businesses is high
    volume low cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again， coming up with a great idea that enables us to do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So so many companies have built their business around that。 And even today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a common question that we always ask ourselves， particularly when we， have a
    new business is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will it scale？ Can we produce or deliver this product or service at scale so
    we can do so much of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's going to let us bring in the revenue and bring our costs down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the basic way that most companies operate。 And over the years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many different metrics have arisen that help companies understand， how well
    they're doing it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously， they can look at the volumes that they're delivering。 Obviously。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can look at changes in their costs。 Our costs coming down as we develop
    and deliver more and more of this product or service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So some metrics that show us how well we're doing our business are fairly clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of them are less clear。 For instance， a very powerful metric is market
    share。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So many companies today obsess over market share because not only does it give
    them an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: indication of how well they're doing relative to their competitors in a given
    industry， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it also has these interesting properties of being a leading indicator of how
    well you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will be doing。 There's a lot of research that goes back to the 1960s and 1970s
    that shows that market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: share is not only a good backwards indicator of how well you've done， but a
    leading indicator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of how well you will likely be doing in the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So many other metrics like market share and others are central to this product
    superiority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or operationally excellent strategy。 Beyond running your business and measuring
    to see how well you're doing it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a company， isn't only interested in fine-tuning those metrics。 They're interested
    in， in fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're mandated to have growth。 It's not enough just to do what you're doing
    a little bit more efficiently and effectively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More shareholders demand growth。 They want more。 They want more than you could
    possibly have delivered before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So where does growth come from in a world characterized by performance superiority
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: operational excellence？ What are the sources of major growth that a company
    can enjoy？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we really see two different sources that at first sound fairly distinct
    from each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when we think about it a little bit more carefully， there are actually just
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flavors of the same kind of growth。 So let's think about them a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One source of growth is taking the products of services that we've been delivering
    already。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and bringing them to new customers， either going to new customer segments or
    to new geographies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's taking this great product of service and bringing it to new customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's clearly a source of growth。 The other source of growth that I'm sure
    all of you could think about would be innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in addition to producing and distributing a certain set of products of service，
    what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more can we do？ So let's go back to the folks who developed these great products
    of services in the beginning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and say， give us some new products of services。 Let's go back to the R&D people
    and say， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have a certain degree of expertise that， has enabled you to bring us the
    current product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What more can you do to bring us either variants of that product or entirely
    new ones that haven't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: existed before？ So an obvious source of growth would be new products or extensions
    to existing products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So at first， this idea of taking our current product and bringing it to new
    customers or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coming up with new and different products seem fairly different from each other。
    And indeed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the tactics associated with them， the expertise within the corporation does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have to be a bit different。 When we step back and think strategically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: both of them actually have a lot in common。 Other than share this basic idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have a certain degree of product expertise。 How can we extend it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How can we take that product expertise and either extend it to new customers
    or extend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it to new products？ So regardless of the specific way that you go after growth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the main source of growth， is extending our overall product or service delivery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's what most companies have to be really good at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're good at doing a certain kind of thing。 We're going to try to do it as
    efficiently or effectively as possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now how can we take that product expertise and extend it in new directions？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how do companies go about doing that？ How do they go about running the existing
    business as well as figuring out how to extend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the product？ Well， if you look at the organizational chart of almost any company
    on the planet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the company， tends to be organized around the different kinds of products and
    services that it delivers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you'll have a product manager or a brand manager。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's all about having separate silos around the different products or services
    and then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organizing all the activities that way。 And so very often。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: each of these different silos will be responsible not only to run its。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: own operation as efficiently as possible， but thinking about its own way of
    extending that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of product expertise。 And so if we sum up the way that most companies operate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's all about this idea of product， or service expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the competitive advantage that so many managers， so many academics， so
    many industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experts have focused on for so many years。 We are the best at conceptualizing，
    developing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: delivering a certain kind of product or service， and we're going to stay ahead
    of our competitors by becoming more efficient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by going to new， markets and always developing new product or services that
    are going to keep us a step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ahead， product expertise。 So what I've just described to you is pretty standard
    stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For most of you， if you look at your experience as a consumer or through your
    work experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll realize that that's the way that most businesses operate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And instead of just calling it business， we can now put a label on that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that label I like to use is product centricity。 See， in the old days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we didn't need a special label for it because for most companies， this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was business and business was this set of steps that I just described to you。
    But today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're seeing different kinds of business models emerging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we want to now distinguish the set of practices that I just described。
    In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like to use a metaphor about a fish swimming around in water。 So while a fish
    is in the water。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it doesn't realize that it's in water until it jumps， into a new environment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It jumps out of the water for a moment and realizes， "Uh-oh， I'm in a different
    environment， now。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I kind of like the old environment better。 I'm going to stay in the water。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is exactly the kind of issue that many companies are facing today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're swimming around in their own water of product centricity。 It works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It keeps the business going。 It gives them some opportunities for growth。 And
    for many companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's totally fine。 But for other companies， whether it's out of desperation
    or perhaps opportunity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're， looking for different kinds of environments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're looking for different kinds of strategies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're seeing more and more companies jumping out of the water and saying， "Is
    it better， out here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How can I operate out here？ Should I operate out here？"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's why we're now going to put a specific label on the old way of doing
    things， product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: centricity。 So again， most of you understand that。 This is business as usual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the concepts that Barbara was talking about implicitly referred to a
    product centric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: approach and just to sum up the product centric world before we kind of start
    moving away， from it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have this one other slide for you here that shows you many of the classic
    characteristics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a product centric business。 And if you look up and down the slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you won't find a lot that's tremendously insightful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's the point I want to make is that the traditional product centric
    approach to， business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， focusing on performance superiority or operational excellence is by now
    second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nature to most managers。 So if you look at， as the slide shows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the kinds of customers that we're going after， the kinds of metrics that we're
    using。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the overall focus and the organization of the business， it's pretty standard
    stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just want to call your attention to this one point towards the bottom of the
    slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the idea of the mental process。 And I love this idea of divergent thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it goes back to an idea I mentioned a few minutes ago。 We have this product
    expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What can we do with it？ How can we spread it out to other kinds of customers
    and other kinds of businesses？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， implicitly， that's the way that most businesses operate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we hire people who can think divergently， who can take our particular core
    business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and think about ways of spreading it out to new markets and new products and
    services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I want to make that explicit because as we go on， we're going to talk about
    some very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different mental processes as well as different metrics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c96391b128b935b8efc49d32973c412d_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And all of the points that you see on this slide are going to become quite different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
