  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we've talked about lots of things with regard to brands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've talked about the initial positioning of a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've talked about how to create brand elements that go together to create a
    brand image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the things I've been emphasizing throughout the whole sessions is
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a brand has to be updated。 A brand has to stay modern。 A brand has to adapt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so a very important part of branding is to think about how to reposition
    a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have an initial start， but maybe the times have changed， maybe the customer
    base has changed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you have to think about how can you keep this brand fresh？ How do you reposition
    a brand？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to talk about that now。 And it's this notion that the brand equity
    must be actively managed over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you wait until a brand is out of date， it's much harder than to reposition
    the brand。 So ideally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the best way to keep a brand fresh is to constantly think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And might tweak it here and there。 Think about it all the time so that it stays
    fresh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That would be the best way。 Brand meanings must be reinforced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But sometimes they need to be adjusted just a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And new sources， new ways of identifying the equity should be identified。 Why
    does this happen？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， I can think of at least five reasons and there's probably more reasons
    than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But let's go over some of these。 One reason for a brand repositioning is that
    the initial positioning that you came up with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wasn't right。 It was poorly conceived。 And you might know this because you thought
    this was really cool and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers were going to be interested but actually you didn't see the interest
    you， anticipated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or the sales are just not what you thought。 And one of the reasons is the brand
    is poorly conceived。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That being the case， you got to reposition the brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason is maybe you have a perfect positioning for， a particular target
    audience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that audience is hard to reach， isn't profitable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was a really good idea for a really good customer segment but it wasn't a
    good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: business opportunity。 And so therefore you may need to reposition the brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason may be because it just gets out of date as I mentioned over and，
    over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things about being a marketing professor is that things change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You got to constantly change。 You got to keep up with things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so your old marketing approach might become obsolete。 Then you have to change
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing could be it might just lose its edge。 It made sense at one point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just kind of old and now people want to do something new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it isn't really that it was wrong or that people's taste change so much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just that it seems old and tired。 And so you need to do something to make
    it fresh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And another idea， along those same lines is tired。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one is more that it becomes old fashioned and the other is it just becomes
    old hat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But those are similar ideas。 It just gets old。 There isn't nothing wrong with
    it but you really want it to be new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And by the way， one of the really big things that happens is people go out and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make purchases sometimes because they have needs。 And sometimes they make a
    new purchase just because they want something different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something new。 And if the brand seems same old， same old。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's not enough of a reason to go out and， make a new purchase。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these are some of the reasons that are needed for a brand change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There are others。 When you think about repositioning a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the biggest thing you have to think about， is consistency， consistency， consistency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So except for that one example where I told you about Google。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where they go out of their way to do things that are a little bit different
    each time。 Most brands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when they do this reposition， they have to have a position that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consistent with the old position or at least close enough to the old positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So consumers believe it。 If it's really radically different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people won't make the connection necessarily。 There's some examples where that
    can work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But most of the time， the best way to reposition a brand is to do something
    that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consistent with the brand DNA。 And so let's think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's some psychological theory that can go back， behind this so I can show
    you why this happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why consistency is generally so important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And this is some very old research that was done on understanding why people
    smoke。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it had to do with people's attitudes towards smoking。 So this is a psychological
    theory here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's assume I'm me， I'm myself。 And let's say I smoke。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's say that I know that smoking causes cancer， cancer causes death， and
    I don't want to die。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if that's the case， how do I justify that I smoke？ Because there's this
    inconsistency。 I'm me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like myself， I don't want to die。 I think smoking causes cancer。 Something
    doesn't work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what psychologists found out was that people rationalize or they do something
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the links of this chain so that it is consistent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's the way they can justify their behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because people like to be consistent with themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what are the ways different people kind of rationalize to allow themselves
    to smoke？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well one resolution is you say， okay， I smoke， I don't want to die of cancer，
    I don't believe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the data。 And so this is the kind of thing where I said you have this bias selective
    interpretation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was mentioning presidential campaigns。 There's experiments that show。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you show the same data to smokers and non-smokers and they， will interpret it
    differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people frequently interpret the message or the data consistent with what
    they already， believe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a theme that I've mentioned all along。 So this is a pretty well known
    way to rationalize the behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to do it is to say， no， no， I believe the data， it's pretty conclusive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smoking causes cancer， I really don't want to die from cancer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what you do is kind of lie to yourself。 And you say， you know， I don't really
    smoke。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I only smoke when I drink， I only smoke on vacation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so it doesn't really count and therefore I have no inconsistency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People do this with diets all the time。 They make all sorts of rules。 When I'm
    on vacation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: food isn't fattening。 If it's a little bit burnt， I can eat as much as I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's all sorts of rules that people make。 That's that resolution where
    you kind of figure out a way that you can feel good about yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third resolution to this particular one says， okay， I know I smoke， I know
    it causes， cancer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you know what？ I'm going to die anyway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And it may not be that I die from this。 All of these are consistent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is a very important concept for marketers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you're putting out a message when you're trying to reposition your brand
    that isn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consistent， consumers will reject it and will look for a way to rationalize
    the message。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: so it makes sense to them。 It's a consistency theory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a drive to maintain consistency within your thinking systems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what you do is if it's not consistent， you change whichever one is the weakest
    so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that it is consistent。 So what's the famous example？ It's with Osmobile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Osmobile was known as a car that was associated with that， with my father。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now one thing that's probably obvious， but let me just say it here， cars are
    for young， people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cars are powerful performance。 People like young people cars， energy cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't like old people cars， okay？ So the notion that Osmobile was associated
    with my father was a turn-off to younger people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Osmobile understood that。 That was obvious。 And so what they tried to do was
    they came out with a new ad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: new excitement， new car， to say， "No， no， we're not a funny-done car。 We're
    an exciting car。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a car for young people。"， What happened here？ There's cognitive dissonance
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is the association with dad in Osmobile was extremely strong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The association that my dad is not exciting was extremely strong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the weak link here was that Osmobile cannot be an exciting car。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that was a very strong inconsistency they couldn't fight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was so strongly associated with my father and fathers are so not exciting
    that people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just did not believe the new ad。 It was obviously hurt even more by the ad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the slogan at the time was， "This is not your father's Osmobile。"， And anybody
    knows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as soon as I say， "This is not my father's Osmobile，" what you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing is reinforcing that it's exactly my father's Osmobile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is known as one of not a good campaign。 Most marketers will say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"You just didn''t get this right。"， And you know， there was another problem
    here。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about the brand name。 It is literally called an old mobile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is all of this is not good and it was such a hard thing to change and to
    reposition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they actually took the car off the market， which was kind of astonishing
    because Osmobile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: had very， very high brand awareness， but they just could not get themselves
    added this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cognitive inconsistency。 So this is a very important thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A better way to do it is to not wait until it's so hard to change that it's
    impossible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you have to take the product off the market。 A better way to do it is to
    gradually change these associations in small ways so that people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can still maintain that brand familiarity and believe the repositioning。 So
    you can do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I mentioned this earlier， you can do it by kind of updating the symbols。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or maybe you can start to change the brand name and I can show you how you can
    show change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the brand name slowly to reflect the evolving identity。 Or you can use different
    slogans。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So all of these elements that we talked about before can be subtly tweaked in
    order to reposition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the brand as you need to to keep it modern。 And you can also do it if you're
    going to use the brand to stretch the brand to go into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: new products。 And so you might want to broaden the brand meaning so that it's
    more flexible and adaptable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: to go into new products。 There are two ways to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the ways is called the just noticeable difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what this says is that you make these little tweaks very subtle from point
    to point to point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_16.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So they're barely noticed。 You do this say every year。 If you look over 20 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the difference from the first one to the last one is very， very hot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so there's a lot of packaging examples which we can show you where just
    with tiny。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little tweaks each time you still believe it's the same product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you look from one version to a version 65 years later， you'll see a radical
    difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the brand stays modern。 Many consumer package goods do this kind of just
    noticeable difference positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_18.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another way to do it is what's called the butterfly effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what this says is that I'm going to move from one to another in a big jump。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are going to notice that it's different。 It's not a just noticeable difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a bigger difference。 And the reason I'm going to do this is to keep it
    modern and new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because for some categories like cosmetics， like clothing， and it's the notion
    of clothing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the idea of keeping it modern and keeping it fresh is part of the reason to
    buy。 And in that case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't need the change from one to another to just be subtle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can make it so that it is kind of a little bit exciting and more modern， but
    it doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: necessarily need to。 But it's more modern， but it still stays within believability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's called the butterfly effect。 So it's not so extreme that I don't
    think it's the same thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it is noticeable。 And so these are two different ones and we can show you
    a number of different examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_20.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: on those two different ones。 Okay。 And then I can show you some examples of
    evolving trademarks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's the Jolly Green Giant that was kind of out of date and they made a new
    Jolly Green。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Giant that was fitter， more athletic， taller， stood up straighter， and looked
    more like a， modern。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I guess， giant。 Then there was， please don't squeeze the Charman。 And they updated
    that packaging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: updated that spokesperson to look more modern。 These are subtle changes。 There
    was another change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Charlie the Tuna。 I mentioned him earlier。 Very fun animated character。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of got a little out of date， and they made him more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: modern and changed the colors a little bit， changed the perspective of him and
    just kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of made him a hippo guy。 More recently， there was a transformation on the hamburger
    chain， Wendy's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again， I know a little bit more about the market research that went into
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was a lot of changes here。 One of the changes here is they got out their
    slogan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their slogan that used to be part of， the sign was old fashioned hamburgers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wendy's menu has got to be broader now。 They do more than just hamburgers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the things they pulled out was that slogan。 They changed their typeface。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They went from an old fashioned typeface to a more modern typeface。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They did find when they did the market research that the character， this Wendy
    character， which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was Dave Thomas is the founder of Wendy's， it was his daughter at the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She's not identified with that Wendy character and they liked that Wendy character。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they kept the character， but they made her， she used to be in a little circle
    and she。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: used to be contained in the circle。 Now she's kind of bouncing out of the circle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And so all of that made the logo seem more modern， more expansive。 You know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lots of things are possible that you can get in a Wendy's now。 And with these
    subtle changes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's still very much identified as a Wendy's。 You can keep the brand， you can
    keep the brand modern。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but connected enough so that it doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_26.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: people still know it's Wendy's and it's not a surprise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_28.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The other kinds of ways that people have named is actually to change the brand
    name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Boston Chicken was the original name of the chain of restaurants that provides
    dinner， food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously Boston Chicken suggests that they're just selling chicken。 And so
    they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they sell way more than chicken。 So they change their name to Boston Market。
    And in that case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what they're doing is trying to broaden the flexibility of the brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Weather Channel found out that they were going to make a lot of their revenues，
    not off TV， anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but off apps and different kinds of ways of saying weather。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they changed their name from the weather channel to weather companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Starbucks very famously changed their name from Starbucks Coffee to just
    their image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They just have the image of the mermaid now。 They not only got rid of coffee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they kind of got rid of Starbucks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7d20b18cbddd21a1b6872eeac9b150d_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But people still know it is Starbucks by that image。 So what's the best way
    to do it？ The one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a brand that's really done a very good job of keeping themselves modern is BMW。
