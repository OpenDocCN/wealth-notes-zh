- en: So， what are the implications of this model for you as you think about your
    organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and the organizations you're trying to navigate and negotiate with？ So first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the models reveal sources of power and constraints on power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So each of these models point out ways in which decisions get made。 Those are
    opportunities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they're also limitations。 So this suggests that savvy analysis requires
    using multiple perspectives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the reasons this is so important is that we tend to bring a particular
    lens to， situations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We tend to have chronic ways of thinking about situations。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allison's entire motivation was to push the field of political science away
    from their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: chronic lens of rational analysis。 What is your chronic lens？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you tend to think of organizations and actions as rational actions？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of you might have a chronic lens of bureaucratic politics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You think all of it is fed up from the individual bargains that are cut at the
    lower levels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then few of us， and we're going to emphasize this more， few of us have this
    middle model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this model to， this routinized process where a lot of organizations' behavior
    is just， inertia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just routine。 But it's not a very interesting one。 So it usually doesn't
    draw our attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't tend to explain behavior that way。 Allison's point is we're going to
    better understand organizations if we bring multiple perspectives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if we move from one to the other as we try to understand what happened or predict
    what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is going to happen in the future。 This is connected a little to some recent
    research by Phil Tetlock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tetlock is now here at the University of Pennsylvania。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book was written when he was at Berkeley。 And it was a unique study of
    judgment in the field of psychology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually when judgment study in psychology， especially historically， it's done
    with experimental。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: research， often using students。 And they're short， they're short little stimuli。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tetlock did something quite unusual。 He decided to study the judgment of real
    world experts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: economists， political commentators， political scientists about real world problems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Things like what's going to happen in South Africa， what's going to happen with
    the dissolution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the Soviet Union， what's going to happen in future elections， where is the
    economy going？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So over a 10-year period of time， which at the time was unheard of to study
    judgment this， way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over a 10-year period of time， Tetlock captured people's predictions and then
    followed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what actually happened in the world to figure out how good they were at making
    these predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what he found was that there is rampant overconfidence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The overconfidence we observe in the lab， we also observe in the real world。
    And importantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he was trying to understand what distinguishes those who are overconfident。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from those who are well calibrated。 And he couldn't find anything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nothing that you might think would predict that。 Education， political orientation，
    gender。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these things don't relate to that。 He did find one difference though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and he called it cognitive style。 And he differentiates what he called foxes
    barring framework from Irving Berlin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: foxes， from hedgehogs。 This actually differentiated those who are overconfident
    from those who are better calibrated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f6249835322faa2f6d49698fc313155e_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What does he mean by it？ Hedgehogs， Tetlock says， are thinkers who know one
    big thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They aggressively extend the explanatory reach of that one big thing into new
    domains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They display bristly impatience with those who don't get it and express considerable
    confidence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they are already pretty proficient forecasters， at least in the long term。
    Foxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the other hand， are， Tetlock says， thinkers who know many small things， tricks，
    of the trade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're skeptical of grand schemes。 They see explanation and prediction not
    as deductive exercises。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but rather exercises in， flexible ad hocory that requires stitching together
    diverse sources of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these judges are rather different about their own forecasting ability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the big distinction， and this is the only distinction he found that
    predicts good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: judgment in these real world， meaningful situations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We bring it up now because foxes are exactly the kind of folks that would use
    all three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: levels from Allison's models。 Foxes are those who don't go to the map believing
    in Model 1 or go to the map believing in Model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3。 They think， "Well， I need to look at these situations from multiple perspectives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to be a better judge of what happens next if I bring multiple lenses
    to this situation。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally on the implications for Allison's models， not all models are equally
    appreciated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My hypothesis is that while Model 1 has been long dominant in political analysis
    and many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of us obsess on Model 3， especially in our own organizations， we're all too
    familiar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the bureaucratic negotiations that go on in the hours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We sometimes might neglect what happens in other organizations， but we tend
    to think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some about Model 3。 What really gets neglected is Model 2， these organizational
    processes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might think just to make it a little more real， what are some examples in
    your organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where routinized processes are driving what you guys are doing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Routineized processes would be the best explanation of why some outcome occurs
    or some decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is made。 Over time， I've collected some examples from students of these things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They talk about things like the British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf a few
    years ago， how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BP responded to that， some of the MMS licensing issues that led to it in the
    first place， how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the government responded after Katrina， Hurricane Katrina in 2005。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of it was just routinized behavior， not well adapted to the circumstances
    that were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: taking place then。 The intelligence gathering that took place before and after
    9/11。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are all governmental， examples， but there are non-governmental examples
    as well。 In hospitals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many routinized procedures in hospitals and for good reason， sometimes they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have those procedures in order to protect downsides， but so much becomes routinized
    as， a result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example some students gave a few years ago was campus recruiting。 At the
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was at Yale and some students said， "I'd like to think that these organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come and they recruit at Yale because we're the best school， but it could just
    be， in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fact I'm sure it is in some cases， just because that's what they've been doing。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or somebody said it in motion 10 years ago because they were close or they knew
    somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and now it's just the way things are done。 We have examples of students who
    work in newspaper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much of newspaper's operations are just， built around that daily cycle of
    producing the newspaper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， pushing you on this kind of underappreciated aspect of what happens
    in organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's underappreciated model for why organizations do what they do， what organizational
    processes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are driving your organization， what organizational processes might you attend
    to if you want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influence what happens in organizations。 We have one more implication and it
    doesn't flow as immediately from Allison as from all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the psychology research that's come since Allison and that is don't forget
    about chance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A danger of the framework that Allison is suggesting is that you can fully explain
    what happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but if you fully explain what happens， you're going to leave out the role of
    chance and that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to make you a bad predictor of what happens in the future because there's
    always。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of uncertainty in chance in what happens in the future。 So one last admonition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't forget about chance。 So it turns out that even those in the administration
    at the time were thinking about chance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was a group， I mentioned before that this was where the terms hawks and
    doves comes， from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but in subsequent analysis people have talked about there's kind of an owlish
    group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: neither hawk nor dove。 This included McNamara， Bundy and Ball and it came from
    the weight that they assigned to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the risk of desperate irrational Soviet action or inadvertent escalation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f6249835322faa2f6d49698fc313155e_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In other words， they knew that things may not happen exactly according to plan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They knew that there was chance of accident that would lead to disaster or the
    initiation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of nuclear war and that consideration of chance informed their decision making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: McNamara late in life they did a documentary on him and he talked about this，
    the crisis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is 50 years， 40 years， 45 years after it happened and he says， "I don't
    think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Cuban Missile Crisis was unique。 The Bay of Pigs， Berlin in 1961。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cuba and then later events in the Middle East and Libya and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so on all exhibit the truth of what I'll call McNamara's law。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: McNamara's law is it is impossible to predict with the high degree of confidence
    what the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: effects of the use of military force will be because of the risks of accident，
    miscalculation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: misperception and inadvertence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f6249835322faa2f6d49698fc313155e_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In my opinion this law ought to be inscribed above all the doorways in the White
    House and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Pentagon and it is the overwhelming lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis。
    Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he's talking about military but we know that chance applies to non-military
    situations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well and the last implication is we've got these perspectives， we've got
    these models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we need to also account for chance。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
