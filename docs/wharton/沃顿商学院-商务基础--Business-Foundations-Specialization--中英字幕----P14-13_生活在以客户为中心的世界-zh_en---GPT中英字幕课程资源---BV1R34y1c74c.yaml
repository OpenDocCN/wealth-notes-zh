    a little。

- en: bit about some of the challenges that it requires companies to meet， changing
    incentive structures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on。 What I'd like to do is just to step back and review all the aspects
    of living in a customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: centric world。 What does that mean and then we'll spend a little bit more time
    talking about some of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the other aspects of it。 So first， if you live in a customer centric world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let me ask you this question。 What's the overarching objective for the commercial
    enterprise？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You remember I asked that and we discussed it before for the product centric
    enterprise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what is it for the customer centric enterprise？ So usually when I ask this
    question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people give me a lot of customer oriented answers， building loyalty， creating
    satisfaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: getting people to buy things。 Yeah， that's all nice。 That's all terrific。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to do all that and we hope that customer centricity will help us do
    those things but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's not the single overarching objective。 The overarching objective is the
    same as it was before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To maximize shareholder value。 To maximize the profits of the company in the
    short run and the long run。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recognizing， the time value of money。 And even though that point seems kind
    of silly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's the same thing， that's why I want to， emphasize it。 But in the end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the overall objective of any commercial enterprise is to make as much money，
    as possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is this。 There's too many people who think that the money making
    thing is uniquely associated with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product centricity but it's not。 There's lots of different paths that we can
    follow and while customer centricity is quite。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different in many ways from product centricity， it's a path that's not a path
    that's not a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: path that actually might help you get there faster and better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I want to emphasize that point that we're trying to achieve the same overarching。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goal but in a very different way。 So let's talk about how we achieve it。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going back to product centricity。 For most firms， the performance superior ones
    and the operationally excellent ones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it， was all about blockbuster idea。 Let's produce a lot of it。 Let's produce
    it efficiently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's think about the next thing to produce。 And again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that formula has worked for so many companies， still works today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is it in the customer centric world？ What is it that we celebrate in
    the customer centric world？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going back to the Harras and the Tesco and the IBM。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this at this point might be more subtle but it's very， very important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we celebrate in the customer centric world is customer heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea that not all customers are created equal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea that some customers are just inherently much more valuable， much more
    profitable than。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other customers。 See， in the old days， companies didn't know the profitability
    of customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They didn't understand how customers are different from each other。 And again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they didn't care because they were so intent on just pushing products out， there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once they started realizing the customers are different from each other， at
    first it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was a nuisance。 Oh my gosh， different customers。 We're going to have to talk
    to them in different ways and develop different products for them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was a nuisance。 It added to our costs。 It was a hassle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the more we learn about our customers， the more we realize they're really，
    really different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from each other。 And it's always true。 We can't avoid that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So unless we're going to paint ourselves into a corner and only work with one
    kind of， customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need to acknowledge and celebrate that heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to find a way to say that these differences across the customers not
    only exist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they're， a good thing。 Let's find the kinds of customers who can be very
    valuable to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's make them valuable and let's find others like them。 And at the same time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's find ways of dealing with the other customers in a reasonably， profitable
    manner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we celebrate heterogeneity。 One point I want to emphasize along the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I say this over and over and over again， but it's important to make it explicit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that when we're focusing on heterogeneity and， we're focusing on the profitability
    of our customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're talking about future profitability。 Notice that I'm always pointing over
    here to the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's great to look at past profitability in many cases that will be a guide
    towards future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: profitability， but it's not a perfect one-to-one match。 So we need to use our
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to use models and technology in order to project the future value of
    our customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the celebration of heterogeneity isn't only what the customers have been
    worth and which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers have been the most valuable， but it's which ones we think will be
    most valuable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going back to my example about the MBA students and the airlines， most of the
    value is what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to create and extract in the future。 And that's the really pivotal
    role of this idea of customer lifetime value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now here's a tough question for you。 Okay， we're going to want to measure CLV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to want to manage around it。 How do we do that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we look at a company as it starts changing from being product-centric
    to customer-centric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what kinds of tactics change？ So one point that I want to emphasize right now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we're going to go into much greater， depth in module three are those three
    tactics that lie at the heart of customer centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are the tactics that make it possible for companies to potentially make
    more money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being customer centric than product centric。 And you see those words right here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's all about customer acquisition， customer retention， customer development。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a lot of you might be looking at those words and saying， well that's not
    new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies have been acquiring customers forever。 Companies have been thinking
    about retention and development。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making customers more valuable。 These ideas are not new。 And you know what，
    they're not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's true。 But in many cases， these ideas are treated at a fairly low level
    within the marketing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organization。 Because the marketing organization is often there just to support
    the product-centric blockbuster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mentality。 So it's all about how can we get as much stuff out there as quickly
    as possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's all about coming up with the message。 Very often branding might be associated
    with products-centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not always， but in many cases it is。 And so instead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as we start to think about how customers different from each other， we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to want to ask questions about which kinds of customers should we be acquiring？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much should we be willing to spend to acquire them？ On the retention side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should we try to keep everybody？ Should we roll out the red carpet for everyone？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or should we be a little bit more selective？ And when it comes to customer development。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are there some customers who we can make into， better customers than others？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how do those tactics tie in with the acquisition and the retention？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm going to spend much more time talking about it later on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But my point here is that these three tactics need to be elevated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people who are going to be working on them need to be higher in the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people who are running the marketing function have to be at least as painfully
    aware as acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: retention and development as they are around some of the branding ideas that
    Barbara spoke， about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we're going to get back into that， but I just want to plant that seed
    right now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One point that I've mentioned from time to time， but I want to make a little
    bit more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: explicit here， would be the challenges for the organization itself。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instead of having an organization that's organized purely around the different
    kinds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of products and services， we want to have a customer centric organizational
    structure。 Ideally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the whole org chart would be built around the different kinds of customers we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have and then below them the different ways that we're going to create and extract
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: profits from them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9a450a368b77259b991d69c443ba79ac_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I'm going to give you a nice example of a company that's seriously exploring
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organizational approaches towards customer centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a company that today focuses quite a bit on developing and distributing
    blockbuster， products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But more and more， they're realizing that they actually need to be or could
    be a direct， marketer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The company is Procter & Gamble。 What does Procter & Gamble know about you or
    me？ Actually not much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today， Procter & Gamble's customer would be the retailer， the Walmart's or other
    grocery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: chains who they sell their products to。 But Procter & Gamble recognizes that
    with this shift towards customer centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with， this shift towards direct marketing that eventually their customer will
    be me and you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they want to start to understand who the really valuable customers are，
    how we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sort them out from other customers， and what are things that we can do to create
    more value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for those customers。 So here's an example of a really nice initiative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of many that Procter & Gamble is trying， out。 It's called "My Black is Beautiful"
    and it's aimed at African American women。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And P&G has determined that this is a really valuable customer segment for us。
    We need to be there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to be seen as a trusted advisor。 So take a look at the slide in front
    of you here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a number of very unusual aspects about it compared to traditional Procter
    & Gamble。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or package goods advertising。 First， look at the bottom of the slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see a number of different P&G brands being advertised together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's pretty unusual for a company like P&G or again other package goods manufacturers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to use that kind of umbrella branding， going back to some of Barbara's content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you look higher up on the slide， you notice that they're also talking
    about recipes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and music and all kinds of things that P&G isn't involved with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this would be an example of Procter & Gamble trying to position itself as
    a trusted advisor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they're offering all kinds of products and services to this valuable customer
    segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they don't necessarily make any money on， but they want them to see P&G
    as someone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who has their best interest in mind。 And if you look at the bottom of the slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll notice something fairly unusual。 You see here just the mention of a line
    of cosmetics called Covergirl Queen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Covergirl is a big line of cosmetics under Procter & Gamble， but Queen refers
    to Queen， Latifa。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the popular actress， and so they developed a whole line of cosmetics specifically
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: African American women。 This goes back to our definition of customer centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to the R&D people in saying， "You know， instead of coming up with
    a blockbuster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product that everybody's going to buy， here's a valuable customer segment， we
    want to come。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up with something for them that they're going to find very valuable。 Others
    might buy it too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that would be great。 But this idea of leveraging R&D around a focal segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's starting to show us what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9a450a368b77259b991d69c443ba79ac_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: customer centricity is all about。 Now， I have no idea if this initiative by
    Procter & Gamble will be successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't even know if this is the right segment to go after。 I'm not going to
    comment on that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But given that they are going after this segment， this is the right way to do
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is customer centricity。 And you have to believe that in the Procter & Gamble
    Organizational Chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are some， people who are responsible for "My Black is Beautiful。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they're going to bring whatever resources they can， whatever products within
    the P&G。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: family or outside of it in order to make this customer group as valuable as
    possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what I like to see for customer centricity， and I want to see more companies
    developing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these kinds of organizational and marketing structures around it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bottom line for customer centricity is this idea of relationship expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you remember earlier， the key to product centricity was product expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're really good at developing and delivering a certain kind of product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're always steps ahead of everybody else。 But as we discussed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the cracks in product centricity are shortening some of those steps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's much harder to stay ahead when it comes to product expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when it comes to relationship expertise， I believe that they're a meaningful，
    sustainable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long-run advantages。 And I'm not just talking about soft， squishy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understand your customers in some generic， way。 I'm talking about data。 I'm
    talking about models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm talking about forecasts。 I'm talking about truly understanding your customer，
    your customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: celebrating the， heterogeneity。 One of the beautiful things about it is that
    when you collect the data and you develop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these kinds of forecasts， nobody can ever take it away from you。 It will never
    become commoditized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I believe that if your customers are assets， and I think they are， that
    investing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the data， in the knowledge， in the heterogeneity can actually lead to better
    outcomes to companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than pure product centricity。 There's one more point I want to raise to really
    help us understand the contrast between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product and customer centricity。 You might remember a chart that I showed you
    earlier that showed a lot of the characteristics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a product centric firm。 And I really focused on the idea of the divergent
    thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have this product goodness。 What do we do with it？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here's the complete chart now where it shows you the contrast between the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: centric firm and the customer centric firm。 I hope that you'll see that many
    of them are entirely consistent with our discussion so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: far。 Let's focus on the valuable customers instead of the blockbuster products，
    the different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kinds of metrics， customer retention， lifetime value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to be saying more about those as we go on。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just want to call your attention towards the bottom of the slide。 Instead
    of divergent thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do we do with this product？ It's convergent thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we bring more value to this customer？ What products and services can
    we develop？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What information can we provide？ What can we do in the relationship to create
    and extract more value for these really valuable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9a450a368b77259b991d69c443ba79ac_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: customers？ Again， moving from the product centric world to the customer centric
    world is very difficult。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going from divergent to convergent thinking doesn't happen overnight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It requires all kinds of different incentives。 It requires different kinds of
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A totally different mindset。 That's one of the challenges associated with customer
    centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to talk about a few more。 [MUSIC]。
