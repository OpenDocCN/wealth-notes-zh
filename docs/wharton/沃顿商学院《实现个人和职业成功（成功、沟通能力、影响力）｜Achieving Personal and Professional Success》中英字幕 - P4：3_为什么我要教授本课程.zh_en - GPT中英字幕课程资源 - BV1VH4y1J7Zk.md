 I teach this course because in my own life I found， especially in my education， that。

 there wasn't really a single place I could go to learn about how to think about success。

 Success is a huge， potent word in our culture。 Everybody wants more of it。

 But nobody's really quite sure what it means。 And most of the time when everything's going great。

 you don't even think about it。 You're cruising along and getting things done and enjoying whatever you're doing。

 And then something happens。 You come to the end of a natural course in your life。

 whether it's the end of a school， section or the end of a company that you might be working for or the end of a period of your。

 life。 Your spouse moves， something happens and you're disrupted。

 And very often that's when people sort of fall back and they don't have the resources。

 to think carefully， systematically， thoughtfully about what they really ought to do next to。

 bring their life to a more fulfilling place。 So that's why I created the course。

 I think different insights come to different people at different times。

 I ask my students to write a final paper every year that's just their thoughts about what。

 their personal views on success are and how they intend to achieve them。

 But I tell them that the chances are pretty good that if they wrote the same paper 10， years later。

 they would probably write a different paper。 They would have different ideas about who they are at that stage and what they ought。

 to do next， different experiences to build on， different relationships with people that。

 have inspired them and given them role models that they didn't have before。

 So this is not a course that's going to give you the answers as much as it's going to give。

 you a way for thinking about the question so that you can find your answers。

 And of course the question is the big one。 What do I mean by the word success？ Great。

 So I'll look forward to seeing you again in a moment when we start our next session。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
