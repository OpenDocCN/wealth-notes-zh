- en: We talked about what marketing is。 We've talked about marketing strategy， competitive
    analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer value。 We talked about the idea of segmentation targeting and positioning。
    And the core。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: core concept of a good strong brand， which is brand positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And brand positioning that's so sharp that you can define it in just three words
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 30 seconds as a brand mantra。 That's kind of where we've gone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right down to a sliver of a sharp definition of what， brand is。 And in this
    last piece of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to talk about the notion of experiential brand。 When I talked about what
    is marketing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we talked about things changing from seller's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: market to a buyer's market to the connected community， in the connected community，
    that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when this notion of customer experience comes in。 And brands like just general
    markets and customers' experiences also have become very experiential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's not enough to justify a brand in terms of a crisp， clear brand mantra
    and a， crisp。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clear brand positioning。 But you also have to define all of the experience that
    exists around the brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's the smell of the brand？ What's the feel of the brand？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All sorts of other things now become part of what the brand is in this new experiential。

- en: world that we live in。 So what's an experience？ An experience is a process that
    occurs as a result of living through a situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: undergoing， that situation。 So it's not just a moment in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a dynamic notion where you sense or feel this experience。 I'm going to
    define it later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll see that it involves all the senses。 It's social， it's behavioral， it's
    cognitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's emotional。 It's stimulations that are triggered to the sense that you think
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you feel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: They connect the company and the brand to the customer and they place the customer
    action。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the individual's actions and personal occasions in a broader social context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the experience includes all of these kinds of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I've been talking about up to this point really is pretty rational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's where we bring in the emotions and all these other things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I know those of you who know and love brands really understand that brands
    are emotional。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're experiential。 They're not just this hard and fast cognitive point of
    view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so that's what I'm emphasizing here on the point I want to end with in this
    section。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that a brand is an experience。 And so the things on the left are important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to talk about those， but they all have to be augmented to be bigger
    than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and to embody this experience or emotional piece。 So we talked about differentiation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a principle of marketing to be differentiated， the point of difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now in today's brand， these rich brands are not just differentiated， they're
    experientially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: differentiated。 So the differentiation is also in the brand experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not just a single promise， it's a relationship。 You feel towards a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the brands that you just love， if you're an apple lover or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're an Abercrombie lover or something， you have a relationship with that
    brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's over time and it defines you。 It's not just brand attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these cognitive that or these performance attributes or these， product attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a personality。 You think of a brand almost as a friend。 It's not static，
    it's dynamic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not a mass brand because you're co-creating with the brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The brand becomes very individualized， becomes very relevant to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're not just aware of this brand， you're aware of how this brand fits into
    your life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can see by the types of words that I'm saying that really， really strong
    brands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: embody all of this emotional experience。 And so when you define these terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these things that I've mentioned earlier and you， don't just think about brand
    positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You think about experiential brand positioning。 So what does the brand stand
    for？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it should be a multi-sensory strategy。 When you think about brand positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experiential brand positioning， you not only want to think， about what the DNA
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the brand mantra is， you want to think， what's the smell of， the brand？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's the color of the brand？ What's the emotion you feel when you think about
    the brand？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a brand positioning and experiential brand positioning。 And it needs
    to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as any kind of differentiation is， it needs to be distinct from everybody， else's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so you don't want， all hotels don't smell the same， all soaps don't smell the，
    same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have different experiences。 And then the brand promised， the mantra， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not just three words， you know， cognitive words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also needs to describe what that brand promise is in experiential terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's where I'm going to be very clear of what I mean by experiential。
    It needs to have senses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it needs to be what's the vision of it， what does it look， like， what does
    it smell like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe what does it taste like， what does it sound like。 Is there music associated
    with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what does it feel like， what are the senses。 And then when I say feel here，
    what I mean is emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you feel about it？ Is it a happy brand？ Is it a sad brand？ Is it a tragic
    brand？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the emotions you feel with this brand？ What do you think about it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's what we've been talking about。 How does it make you behave or act？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And relate refers to the social environment。 What people， what social context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what culture do you consider or do you put this brand in？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all this experiential aspect of the brand should be in all channels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All channels should have an experiential component to it。 So just to go over
    those again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the sensuous is across the five senses。 You wouldn't have a consistent experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The feel part are the emotions。 You should appeal to the customer's inner feelings
    and build strong emotions to it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cognitive is the intellect， the thought process， the intrigue， the surprise，
    whatever， it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the thoughts。 The behave is the way how people act around it。 It can be inspirational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can cause you to enact a certain way。 And social is the part of the social
    system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the culture that surrounds the brand。 And you want to have these experiential
    functions delivered through the four P's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're back to the four P's。 The product， the place， the promotion。 Only now
    and the price even。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now we're going to define each one of these four P's in experiential ways。
  prefs: []

    a self-designed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customized Nike。 It's not just a product that you're in but anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a shoe that you can co-design， co-create。 You're part of the process that
    makes it very experiential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You choose what you want in your shoes。 You choose what you want in your greeting
    cards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like I said， millennials are very much thinking like this。 They should be part
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you'll， save 20%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it makes price something that you're creating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not deciding what you're going to save 20% on。 You decide what fits in the
    bag。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or even the concept of priceline。com where you kind of name your own price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    said， if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you've got a strong brand， a strong brand makes clear promises。
  prefs: []
