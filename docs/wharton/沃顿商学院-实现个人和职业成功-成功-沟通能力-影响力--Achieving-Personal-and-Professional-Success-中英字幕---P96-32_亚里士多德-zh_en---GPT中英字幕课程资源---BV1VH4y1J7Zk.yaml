- en: So we began this conversation about persuasion with recent work by Chippeth
    and Dan Heath。

- en: And then we went further back to kind of the bedrock work in psychology from
    Chaldini。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we can go back further yet to Aristotle's time and ancient rhetoric because
    they give。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: us a framework that is in some ways simpler than the more recent ones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And yet includes almost all the same elements that the more recent research
    has emphasized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can look at it as here's another framework or we can look at it as here's
    an umbrella。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: concept framework for holding these other more recent ideas。 And I think both
    are useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's just take a moment and understand how Aristotle talked about rhetoric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three means of persuasion according to ancient rhetoric， logos， pathos
    and ethos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Logos is the logic of the idea。 Pathos is the emotion of the audience and ethos
    is the character of the speaker。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can see that these are focused on three different elements in the persuasive
    dynamic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is the speaker， of course the origin of the idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second is the idea itself which needs to be logical。 And finally the audience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the target of the persuasive message， the emphasis being on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: applying the emotions of the target audience。 So these ideas map onto things
    we've been talking about and many of our students around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here certainly in business schools don't need that much help on the logo side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact you might think that they are very strong with logos and kind of neglect
    the other， too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is typical when people think about persuasive messages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They typically think first about the logic of the force of their idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The research we've been talking about with Heath and Heath and much of what
    we talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with Chaldini but especially with Heath and Heath is focused on pathos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a reminder that what makes persuasive messages sticky is what or the emotions
    they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: engender and other people。 So much of what we've talked about emphasized logos
    and pathos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ethos is kind of the neglected leg of Aristotle's framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It shows up a bit in both Heath and Heath and Chaldini but we don't hear people
    talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it as much and people don't understand it as much and they find it harder to
    execute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm going to give you one example on the Ethos side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This example comes from a speech that Ben Franklin gave at the Constitutional
    Convention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very appropriate since we're in Philadelphia the Constitutional Convention was
    here in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Philadelphia and Ben Franklin founded the University of Pennsylvania back in
    the day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So he stood up to a proposal that was made for salaries in some of the executive
    offices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it's interesting to observe how we went about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now remember Franklin was not only a brilliant mind and an inventor and many
    many many other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things。 He was also a diplomat。 He was known as being good with persuasion and
    rhetoric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is how he begins his speech。 He says， "It is with reluctance that arise
    to express a disapprobation of any one article。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the plan。 In which we are so much obliged to the honorable gentleman who
    laid it before us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From its first reading I have borne a good will to it and in general wish it
    success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this particular of salaries to the executive branch I happen to differ and
    as my opinion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: may appear new and shimirical it is only from a persuasion that it is right
    and from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a sense of duty that I hazard it。 The committee will judge of my reasons when
    they have heard them and their judgment may。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: possibly change mine。 I think I see inconvenience in the appointment of salaries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I see none in refusing them but on the contrary great advantages。"， So what
    do you see him do there？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you see Franklin do？ The idea of ethos in rhetoric is that we have to
    convey our character through our speech。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can't get up there and just claim who we are。 We have to show who we are
    in the way we go about trying to persuade other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems that Franklin accomplishes a number of things in the way he begins
    his speech。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One he says that he is basically favorably inclined so he is in some sense flattering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the other side。 He is letting them know that he is not opposed to them in principle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact he is appreciative of them。 He also is claiming in his words disinterestedness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He is neutral on this。 It is not out of some prejudice that he opposes these
    proposals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And he also at the end does this very clever thing which says， "Look judge my
    opinion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact maybe based on your reaction I might change my mind。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He is not saying that he is so fixed that he is a zealot here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That he is coming out from some kind of permanent position。 But rather this
    is my take。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am reasonable。 I am open。 This is my take。 Now we don't know if any of these
    things are true but he is not trying to accurately reflect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: his actual beliefs。 What he is trying to do here is be effective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In persuasion and in rhetoric there is a difference between being right and
    being effective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Franklin here is trying to be effective。 In doing so he really gives us a nice
    example of ethos in persuasive speech。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Back to Aristotle。 One of the ideas here is that the three part framework of
    rhetoric is a simpler way to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: carry forward these ideas about persuasion。 I love the work by Heath and Heath
    and the folks that have worked on that afterwards love。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the work by Chaldini and all that that is produced but sometimes it is a lot
    to keep。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on top of six principles from Chaldini。 The success acronym from Heath and Heath。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aristotle gives us three。 There are times and places when you really need to
    draw on all three of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes you sit down for a very important message， a very important email。
    It is a good reminder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aristotle gives us a good reminder。 Where is my pathos in this message？ Where
    is my ethos？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How am I getting that across？ In what way does my message have logos？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a very simple framework and in that framework we can hang much of what
    we see from Chaldini。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and Heath and Heath。 For example， logos， the inherent logic of the idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see elements of consistency there， scarcity， social influence， simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All falls under the logos rubric。 What about pathos？ The emotion of the audience。
    Well， clearly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: specifically Heath and Heath talk about emotions。 They talk about story， surprise，
    concrete。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of those are elements of pathos。 They are ways or paths towards pathos。
    And finally， ethos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the character， the speaker。 We see people， we have seen Chaldini and Heath and
    Heath talk about this as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially， Chaldini credibility， liking， similarity， authority。 All of those
    are elements of ethos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just suggesting this is kind of an easier framework for hanging many of these
    bigger， ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the newer ideas on the broader framework。 Not least because the challenge with
    persuasion， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: isn't that you understand it as much， as you remember it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to find a framework that is useful for you that you'll actually implement
    that， you'll use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Dean at the Yale School of Management gave an interview a few years ago
    talking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the role of Aristotle's rhetoric in her own messages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is Sharon Oster who's an economist at Yale。 She stepped in to take the
    Dean's role for a few years between permanent appointments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by other deans。 She talked， I heard her talk about how often she would take
    Aristotle's framework to her。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: speeches。 The Dean's of business schools fly around the country giving updates
    about what flying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around the world， talking to alumni， giving updates on what's going on in the
    school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and give a lot of speeches。 She found it useful to think in Aristotle's three-part
    framework， ethos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pathos， logos， and as she talked about it in an interview， she says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"The question of how we teach the， skills and values that people will need
    to create this kind of value-added leadership。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a difficult one。 It's one that all management schools really struggle with。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another framing we think about comes from Aristotle， a leader needs logos， pathos，
    and， ethos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can layer that onto the issues we're discussing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We all as educators think about the logos part because we're in the business
    of training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people and skills like analytics。 I think we do some with ethos， ethics and
    values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we actually do very little with， pathos。 And then Rick Levin who is Yale
    President at the time says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"The passion。"， Oster says， "Yes， how do you get people not only follow their
    own passion but to create。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: passion in others and lead them in that way？"。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Aristotle gives us a great framework。 I found it useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many others have found it useful for millennia。 And here's a nice example from
    a leader in business education talking about how it has。
  prefs: []
