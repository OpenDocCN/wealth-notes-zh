  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    area in the 30s， 40s。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    an amazing run。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People have called him the most influential figure in New York City in the 20th
    century。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's no example across the US of anyone in another city who held power
    as long as， he did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how did he hold power that long？ What can we understand about power from
    observing what Robert Moses did？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a quick story from The Power Broker and especially tapping into this issue
    of organizational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: processes。 So one of Moses's responsibilities included the Triboro Bridge and
    Tunnel Authority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this was the early 30s。 This was the dawn of the use of authorities in the
    US。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And authorities were very focused on particular causes， particular needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need a new bridge built？ Well， we'll organize an authority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can collect tolls on the bridge。 Once the bridge is paid off， the authority

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: It was its own thing， but it was governed by the laws of New York state。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Moses was happy to have this way to build a bridge， but Moses was a man
    of great ambition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moses wanted to build lots of bridges and lots of roads and lots of parkways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He wanted to transform the infrastructure of the New York area and he was very，
    very good， at it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this was limiting that this thing was so focused and limited in time it would
    go away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So he faced a number of problems。 He was also bound by the state laws。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He could only contract personnel in a certain way。 He couldn't hire people to
    do long term planning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he had to live by these state laws which didn't fit with the way he wanted，
    to work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was also limited to building bridges and roads that led to bridges。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's very focused on bridges。 That's kind of the whole concept of authority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At least early in the US was around bridges。 There was one exception with the
    New York Harbor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Otherwise， it was around these very precise infrastructure projects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the last problem was that the bridges made too much money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tolls paid off the bridge in no time at all。 And the maintenance required
    for the bridge was pretty low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the authority would be up， built the bridge， and then it went away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all this revenue that he could produce disappeared as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So what does he do about this？ How does he navigate these problems？ Here's Moses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's not an elected official。 In fact， he had run for office early on to realize
    he wasn't going to win office and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: took this other route to influence。 He had developed expertise in drafting laws。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was well known in Albany。 He had a good track record。 He had gotten many
    things built and done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so he had the confidence of the lawmakers in Albany， the state capital of
    New York。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so his trick was to change the rules， essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He got the law regarding the powers of authorities and the nature of bonds changed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He did this by literally writing legislation and Albany on it。 So under the
    new rules that he wrote。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the authority could retire and issue new bonds。 Under the new rules。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the authority could build projects not inconsistent with bridges。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So remember previously they were limited to bridges and roads leading to bridges
    now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can do anything they want to， as long as they're not inconsistent with
    bridges。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is as liberal as one could write that。 And then finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the authority was not bound by the civil service rules that applied to， the
    government agencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do you do this？ How do you pull this off？ So Carol walks us through this
    amazing story of if the legislators and the public officials。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: had known that he was doing this， they wouldn't have let it go。 Right？ So how
    did he do it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He did a couple of things。 Mostly he surreptitiously dropped the verbiage into
    the back of the bill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or he would use a clause late in the bill that directly contradicted the obvious
    clause。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the front of the bill in this direction。 So partly because he was good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: partly because they trusted him， he was able to do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that wouldn't be sufficient if once it came to light they could change it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was a real trick here。 How could he keep it from being changed？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He did that because he wrote this not just into legislation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He wrote it into the contracts that went with the bonds。 This is something he
    saw。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a capability he saw of authorities that no one else had seen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that bonds once issued are contracts from the bond issuers to the bond holders。
    It's a contract。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And contracts are protected by the Constitution of the United States。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nobody can supersede a contract。 No state authority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: no nothing less than the Constitution can contradict a contract。 So once he
    wrote these specs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these changes in regulations into the contracts associated， with the bonds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he had a contract that the state officials had no power over whatsoever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/be175e56569e839663a96f4482002f7f_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So that was a trick。 And then there was one last element。 And that was， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what about the fact that the funds go， they pay off the bridge too， quickly。
    Therefore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you issue the bonds， fine， but you've got to retire the bonds as soon as the
    thing， is done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was his last trick here。 He wrote， this was an example of his bearing deep
    in legislation terms that completely contradict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the obvious one。 At the top of the legislation， the existence of the authority，
    it says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: same as it always， did。 Once this thing is paid off， it goes away。 It's buried
    deep。 It writes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"The authority shall have power from time to time to refund any bonds by the，
    issuance of new bonds。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other
    corporate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/be175e56569e839663a96f4482002f7f_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: purpose。 Basically， he could do whatever he wants to。 He can issue bonds anytime
    he wants to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And remember that in those bonds are these contracts that give him these rights
    that can't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be superseded by local authorities or state authorities。 They're protected by
    the Constitution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a remarkable power grab and it protected him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It gave him the power essentially to do what he wanted to do for a lifetime。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's really not much of an exaggeration to say for a lifetime he secured his
    power by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mastering the organizational processes that govern the authority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People didn't realize this for a while， but once he had done this， he didn't
    hold back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the mayor in New York at the time was Fierrilla Ligardia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He had been working with Ligardia and he was going to go on to work with Ligardia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Ligardia of course was a very popular mayor。 But when he heard that Moses
    had started hiring people in a very different way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hiring people， he wanted to， running them in a way that conflicted with municipal
    guidelines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ligardia wrote him。 And he said he basically protested and Moses said， "Look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll take it up with my lawyers， and the bondholders。"， And Ligardia's going，
    "The bondholders。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '" he says。 Ligardia says， "The mayor established that。 That''s just the policy
    for the city。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the authority bondholders have absolutely nothing to say。"， Moses's reply
    was quite succinct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He said， "I think you'd better read the agreements and contracts。"， He had check-made
    Ligardia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He had check-made Ligardia for his lifetime。 And with that power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he went on to exercise extraordinary influence over the New York， area。 Thank
    you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
