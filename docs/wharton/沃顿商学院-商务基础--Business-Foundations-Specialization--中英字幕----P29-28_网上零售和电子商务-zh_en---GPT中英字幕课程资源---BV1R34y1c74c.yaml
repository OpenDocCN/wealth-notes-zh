    e-commerce sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they've been growing since 2014， these data shows， started at 5。9% of total
    retail sales globally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sales。

    on China， where 16。

    in 2018。 So China has。
  prefs: []

    the US。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    by cash。
  prefs: []

    online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is interesting also is that UK is as high as China， or even in fact， even
    higher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we look at how frequently people shop online， you see some interesting differences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now please note that these data look at given that people shop online， how frequently
    they， shop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when you look at men， 30% of men shopping is at least once a week online。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you add these numbers in any row together， you'll get 100%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now these data are not saying who shops more often。 It's saying given that they
    shop online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how frequently there's a shop once a week versus， once per month or once a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at differences across ages， it's not surprising that younger people
    are more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even those who are 65 plus at least make one purchase every year， 58% of them
    make one。
  prefs: []

    is now become commonplace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    some interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ideas on what's going on behind the scenes。 If you look at traffic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: percentage of traffic on the PC is e-commerce traffic is about 54%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you look at percentage of sales， it's close to 77%。 What does that mean？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It means more percentage conversions happen on the PC。 On smartphone， it's 33。7%
    e-commerce traffic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but only 10。7% retail sales。 What that means is people are browsing on the smartphone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but when it comes to buying， they probably shift to the PC。 Same way for tablet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's about the same。 So tablet is somewhere in between the PC and the smartphone
    as we would expect it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， PC is the dominant conversion channel when it comes to actually buying
    the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But yes， smartphone is more for browsing， but these numbers are likely to change
    as smartphones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: become better as we've come more used to buying on the smartphone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this is where it stands today。 Now let's ask a broader question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is why is this trend happening？ Why are we shifting more towards e-commerce？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are many reasons for that。 It's convenience， it's ease。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it could be some people say it's lower prices， but let's go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little deeper and try to understand why we are all shifting towards online
    purchases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any one of us， when we are buying a new product， our first task is to get more
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the product。 So in marketing terms， we think of each product as a bundle
    of attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: benefits or features。 So think of a notebook computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A notebook computer has features such as screen size， it's memory， whether it
    has a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: touch screen or not。 And whether the， you know， what's the feel of the keyboard？
    Is it soft？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it hard？ Those are the kinds of features or benefits we are looking at a
    notebook computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can classify these attributes into two types。 Let's say screen size and memory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll call them digital attributes。 Why would we call them digital attributes？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because these are just numbers。 We can actually just get as much of a sense
    of this by looking at online website or looking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at actually going to a store。 But there are non-digital attributes such as feel
    of the keyboard or the feel of the mousepad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll call these non-digital attributes。 Now if you look across products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some products are predominantly consisting of digital attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the other products consist of non-digital attributes。 So let's look at some
    examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: US Open is going on and tennis balls from a well-known brand， I would say are
    mostly digital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attributes。 I know what it is， you know， whether it's hard or soft， the brand
    is there， I've known。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it， so I know I don't need to go open the box and feel the tennis balls to find
    out what， they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then compare that with a card。 We are thinking of buying a new car， we look
    at all the features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: engine size， car size， on the web， but both my wife and I would like to actually
    go and test drive the car before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we buy it because you want to get a better sense of the feel of the car。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How comfortable are the seats？ When I put my foot down， does the engine， does
    the car move or not？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it smooth？ All those are non-digital attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Products that are predominantly digital attributes can be purchased via the
    internet more easily。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these products can more easily shift to online sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Products that have more non-digital attributes， I would say less so because
    the consumer has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to touch and feel the product to get a sense of the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'd like to test drive a car before buying， I'd like to try a pair of shoes
    before I buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even though I know what the size of the shoe is。 So those are the kinds of the
    products examples where I would like to actually touch the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feel the product before I buy。 Now let's super impose on this another important
    aspect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the aspect of repeat purchase。 If I bought a product before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of the non-digital attributes get converted to digital attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at another example。 Once I bought a pair of socks of a particular
    brand and tried them on and used them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know， what they feel like。 First time when I bought them， I didn't know what
    they feel like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether they're soft， or rough， whether they're stretched nicely or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether they fitted on my foot。 But once I've tried them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've used them for a month or so and I need to buy them again， I can reorder
    them online。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because all the non-digital attributes get converted to digital attributes once
    I've tried。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the product or once I bought it。 So the next purchase will be similar to what
    I bought before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same may be true of a shirt。 I usually wear a blue shirt。 I buy it from
    the same company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First time when I tried this， I had to go to the store to see the fit of the
    shirt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But from this part onwards， I just order it online。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because I know exactly what it feels like and how that particular size fits
    me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first purchase is made in a bricks and mortar store and then re-purchase
    gives， goes online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you really think about this， this whole process of digital and non-digital
    attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how non-digital attributes over time gets converted to digital attributes
    is a major。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: driver of increase in e-commerce sales over time。 Because many of the products
    we buy again and again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first time we can buy it to bricks， and mortar store when we buy the same product
    again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the non-digital attributes become digital， attributes and we are very comfortable
    buying them online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This particular phenomenon is giving a dramatic boost to online sales over time
    no matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which country we live in， whether we are male or female， no matter how old we
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's now talk a little bit about competition between online and offline detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an interesting topic and anyone who is starting an online store or an
    offline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: store needs to keep this in mind。 Consumers can shop offline to get a feel for
    the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: look at all the digital and， non-digital attributes and then often go buy online
    at a cheaper price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This phenomenon is referred to as showrooming and I have studied this quite
    deeply in my， research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to minimize showrooming is to price match。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other way is to offer a unique selection in your offline bricks and mortar
    store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Best Buy at one time was very concerned about showrooming but tackled it by
    improving its。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: own online store。 Look at the reverse pattern and this is what Amazon often
    complains about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consumers can search online and buy offline。 This is referred to as web rooming。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does a company like Amazon take care of web rooming？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can improve the speed of delivery， they can improve the cost of delivery
    or reduce。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the cost of delivery or bundle delivery or have better return policies or a
    larger assortment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that can help against web rooming because people will be worried whether they
    go to the offline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: store whether the product will be in stock or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think both offline and online stores have to worry about not just competition
    between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: online stores but between online and offline also through the process of showrooming
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: web rooming and there are ways to tackle both。 I think what we are leading towards
    these days is what we call as omni-channel detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many online detailers are setting up physical bricks and mortar stores where
    people can buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the product。 Wabi Parker is a good example and there are several online matter
    stores that are also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: opening offline stores。 Many offline stores have already set up online stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We talked about Best Buy earlier。 Walmart and Macy's are other good examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having both online and bricks and mortar presence creates what we call as multiple
    channels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some consumers may have preference for one channel， other may have preference
    for another， channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No matter which channel you have a preference for， we have both channels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is called multi-channel detailing。 The difference between multi-channel
    and omni-channel detailing is how well a particular brand aligns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the two channels。 So brands such as Starbucks have created what we call as integrated
    multi-channel experiences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: resulting in omni-channel detailing。 A customer can order offline and buy online
    or customer can order online and buy offline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the two channels are well integrated。 As we go forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: omni-channel detailing is no longer an option but is becoming a necessity。
