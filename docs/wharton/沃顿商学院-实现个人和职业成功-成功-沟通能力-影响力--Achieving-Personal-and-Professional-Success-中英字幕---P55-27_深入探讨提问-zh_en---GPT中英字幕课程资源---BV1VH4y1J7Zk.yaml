- en: Let's take a deeper look at questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I want to think about what questions really do。 And we can look at experts in
    linguistics that have guided us to think about questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've studied them for a long time。 They structure our conversation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They focus us on particular topics。 They also move narratives forward。 So what
    happened next？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or they pause to ensure understanding。 So do you know what I mean by that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or how do you know who is calling？ So these questions are often created to elicit
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I also want to suggest that questions do something different as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They often not only solicit information， but they often guide our answers and
    sometimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: convey information as well。 Now we think of this with leading questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Loftus did some of the most important work in this area。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Loftus had people do things like watch videos of two cars colliding。 So these
    cars got an accident。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then Loftus asked questions。 And she asked how fast were the cars going
    when they smashed into each other？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or how fast were the cars going when they bumped into each other？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or how fast were the cars going when they contacted each other？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now in every case we're asking how fast were the cars going？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But here's what's really interesting is that when people answer these questions，
    they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thought the car was going fastest with the smashed wording。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I thought the cars were going slowest in the contacted wording。 So the other
    thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the car is going almost 41 miles an hour when they're asked how fast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they were going when they smashed to each other。 But only about 32 miles an
    hour when they're asked how fast were the cars going when they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: contacted each other。 So that is the questions we ask can guide the answers
    that we get particularly for questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that have kind of vague or uncertain answers。 So here's some other examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So do you get headaches frequently and if so how often？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or do you get headaches occasionally and if so how often？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again we're getting very different answers。 So frequently people say over
    to a week when we say occasionally it's less than one a week。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the idea is that the way we ask questions can guide us to be very different
    in how we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: answer those questions。 And we think about for example jurors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We sometimes limit questions lawyers can ask potential jurors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So potential jurors might be asked could you be impartial if you knew the defendant
    was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a member of a gang。 Now it turns out that person may or may not be a member
    of a gang but we've now just implanted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an idea by suggesting that they were part of a gang。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or when we say when do you stop taking the money and we're presuming that you
    were taking， money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea here is that the way we ask questions can guide people and sort of
    plant ideas they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very difficult for us to really get out of our minds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this is another story that Loftus did that I particularly like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She had people watch a video of a car going by in a country road。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again she asked how fast was the car going。 Now a week later she brought
    people back in and said I'm going to ask you about that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: video and she asked did you see a barn in the video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there was no barn in the video but here's what's interesting so that week
    before when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she asked how fast was the car going she asked that question in a few different
    ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one question was how fast was the white sports car going while traveling
    along the， country road。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So remember that there was no barn but by asking the question that has the barn
    phrasing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you find is that a week later when people are asked did you see a barn
    people have been。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: asked that question with the barn wording in it。 They reported that they saw
    the barn and they said that it was a barn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they said that it was a barn。 The barn wording in it they reported that
    they saw the barn about 17% of the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast people that never saw a barn there was no mention of a barn when
    they were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: asked to see a barn less than 3% of them said they saw a barn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that is we're seeing a dramatic increase in responses that are completely
    fabricated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where traditionally we think of questions as just gathering information but
    we also know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that questions are also revealing information and guiding answers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so questions can actually play a really important part in the communication
    process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we think about what questions do the traditional ideas that gather information
    but I'm arguing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they actually also reveal information and they reveal a lot of information
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the asker knows as well as information about the context or guiding the
    answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we get different answers as a function of the questions that we ask。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to explain a short experiment that I ran that reflects a stream of
    research that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've conducted that looks at how different questions can elicit different kinds
    of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in this experiment I told people that they're selling a used iPod and that
    it frequently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: crashes。 So there's a problem with crashing on this iPod and they have a lot
    of other information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about this used iPod that they're selling。 Now it turns out then we have these
    Confederates so I paid these research assistants to pretend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they were trying to buy the iPod and they reached out to this participant
    and they asked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of three different questions。 One question the general question said well
    what can you tell me about it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A second question was this positive assumption it doesn't have any problems
    does it or a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: negative assumption question what problems does it have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here if we think about it the general question doesn't reveal any specific
    knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other two questions suggest there's a problem and the negative assumption
    question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in particular suggests that there really is a problem so the what problems does
    it have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: suggests that there's actually a problem that I want to learn about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's a direct approach and the negative assumption is the most direct the
    positive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assumption the general question are less direct and we look at the responses
    that we get people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thought that these participants thought the buyer was much more knowledgeable
    when they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: asked the negative assumption question and least knowledgeable when they asked
    a general。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: question and they thought the buyer was much more assertive with the negative
    assumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: followed by the positive assumption and the general question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the key idea and the most important idea here is the kind of responses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So suppose that you are a potential buyer and you want to learn negative information
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turns out that when people are asked a positive or negative assumption question
    they're getting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much more reliable information they're learning a lot more information about
    the crashes when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're asked these positive assumption or negative assumption questions and
    they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learning very little information when they ask the general assumption question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact in the general assumption case they're learning a lot of information
    about totally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: irrelevant general stuff they're not learning about this problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the key idea and this is just one of several studies that I've run is that
    when you ask。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these more direct questions you're getting far more reliable answers and the
    negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assumption when you presume a problem you're getting the most voracious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The greatest veracity of all the most truthful response comes with that negative
    assumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: question。 Okay。 And in fact people found when they had independent raters judge
    the responses they of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: judged the sound to be most honest when they're asked the negative assumption
    or positive assumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: question。 So one of the ideas here is that when we want to ask these questions
    we should be sure to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ask questions and listen carefully to the answers we want to seek disconfirming
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to challenge assumptions that we have。 So if we're asking a patient
    how compliant they've been with their medication you might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to ask what medications have you missed as opposed to a question like oh
    you haven't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: missed any medications have you or you want to ask what challenges are you facing
    meaning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this deadline as opposed to presuming that they haven't had any challenges like
    oh we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89cf8ffdd261e07a5485de8a02dacec0_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: right on track aren't we？ So we want to presume a problem and we're then more
    likely to gather accurate and truthful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information。 Thank you。 Thanks。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
