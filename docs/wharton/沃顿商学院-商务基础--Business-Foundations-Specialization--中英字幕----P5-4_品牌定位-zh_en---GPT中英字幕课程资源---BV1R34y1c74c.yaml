- en: So in this section I want to finish with that， we talked about STP， we talked
    about segmentation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we talked about targeting， and now I want to talk， about positioning， that's
    the P。 But in thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about positioning， I really want you to think， about what is a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because one of the most important， aspects of a brand is brand positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's also the positioning in the STP framework， but it's really the essence
    of the brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the brand positioning。 So let's start with what is a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then we'll get into this notion of positioning。 But just to anticipate where
    I'm going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: positioning is positioning your product， to meet the needs of the target segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's the basic definition。 But one of the ways I'm going to focus on is a
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to do that is to brand that positioning。 And so I really want to get to this
    notion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of what is a brand。 Formally a brand is just a trademark。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a brand you want to legally protect， your brand and trademark it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's if you talk， to lawyers about a brand， they'll talk about it， as
    a trademark。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we as marketers know that a brand is way more， than just a trademark。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People have in the past talked about brand， as a relationship or a contract。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a promise of the company， of certain specific benefits to the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So some kind of brand relationship or branded relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so it's much more than just the trademark。 It's a promise。 It's consistency。
    It's benefits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's what you come to expect from a brand。 And that's been the traditional definition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of what a brand is。 In today's world， a brand is a little bit bigger than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because we mentioned before， this， is a connected community， and customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are talking to other customers。 Really what a brand is in the real definition
    of a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is whatever the customer thinks it is。 That's what the brand is。 What sits in
    your customers' heads。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: regardless of what you， try to put there， is what your brand actually is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you have a very strong branded message， and something like Disney。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is a very strong brand name， and a very clear positioning， then hopefully
    what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Disney thinks their brand is， is what the customers think it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if your message is not so clear， and you want your brand to mean something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what the customers think is something different， guess who wins？ It's the
    customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what your brand is， what sits in the customer's head。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so a lot of what marketing is and understanding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about brands is to do market research to understand， how customers do think
    about your brand。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we're talking about the notion of positioning。 And so a positioning statement
    is a definition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/91a90851d5e44de7bce85b35a3ee971e_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: or a positioning statement for a particular brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have here two examples of positioning statements， for two brands of personal
    computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are a little bit old。 It's when Apple and IBM were really focusing， on
    personal computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I want to use these examples because they're， very clear， crisp positioning
    statements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think we can learn a lot by understanding， these positioning statements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look first at Apple Computer's Positioning Statement。 And if we read
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it says Apple Computer offers， the best personal computing experience， to students，
    educators。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: creative professionals， and consumers around the world through its innovative
    hardware， software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and internet offerings。 That's one positioning statement。 Compare that to IBM，
    which was very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very different at the time。 IBM is for businesses who need computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IBM is the company you can trust for all of your needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/91a90851d5e44de7bce85b35a3ee971e_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Very， very different positioning。 That is a really good positioning statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when one company can be so differentiated， from the other company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're going after different target， segments， and it should be quite clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the positioning statement。 Let's break that positioning statement into its
    parts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that we can understand what a good positioning statement has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/91a90851d5e44de7bce85b35a3ee971e_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And let's focus here on the Apple Computer。 There's three pieces to the positioning
    statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's who is the target segment？ What is the point of difference that they're
    offering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to that target segment？ And then there's what is the frame of reference？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the frame of reference is who are the other competitors， that they are comparing
    themselves to？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The target segment here， and if you think about Apple， the target segment is
    students， educators。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: creative professionals。 A brand should have a crisp target segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even if that's not the only people who use the product。 So nowadays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple's so popular that everybody has an Apple。 Your grandmother has an Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Somebody who's not a student has an Apple， not just creative people anymore。
    Yet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even though Apple's are ubiquitous， and lots and lots of people have Apple products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: still its position to creative people。 It's a very design-y brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it still has a very clear target segment， even if that doesn't limit who
    might use the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It has a point of difference。 What's the point of difference for Apple？ It's
    innovative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple offers state-of-the-art products。 We look for design and innovation from
    Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's its point of difference。 And in this case， what's the frame of reference？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this particular positioning statement， it's other personal computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: personal computing experience。 So you have these three pieces to a strong positioning，
    statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the target segment， the point of difference， and the frame of reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And positioning is defining the value proposition， in these three terms， the
    target market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the point of difference， and the point of parity。 Now you can play around with
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you think about this and get into it a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you may realize that your point of difference， is going to be relative to the
    frame of reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， let me give you an example of--， this product isn't on the market
    anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's-- crest made this chewing gum。 If the crest chewing gum was referred
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the frame of reference was other toothpaste products， then crest chewing gum's
    point of difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is it's a toothpaste product that's in gum form。 On the other hand， if you take
    crest chewing gum。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and compare it as a frame of reference to other chewing， gums。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the point of difference is this is a chewing， gum that has toothpaste in it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these two things go together， and part of the art of coming up with a good
    positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is figuring out who's the right target market to go after， and also what's the
    frame of reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what's going to be your point of difference。 And playing around with those
    two pieces。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a lot of the art of positioning。 Very important concept， but you really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: need to understand these three ideas--， target marketing， point of difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and frame of reference， or point of parity。 And what you're going to do is，
    once you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decide on your positioning statement， you use all of the elements of the marketing
    mix。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we've already talked about-- product， price， promotion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and place-- to position your product to meet， the needs of the target segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And positioning should be clear and simple， and focus on a few key benefits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes people talk about this as a unique selling proposition。 The position
    must be defensible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so you want to take a positioning that you own， and that other people can't
    copy very easily。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the really important thing is you cannot be everything， to everyone。 If
    you do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have no position。 You must make choices。 You must focus。 You must choose
    a target segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must choose a point of difference。 You must choose a frame of reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to have a clear positioning。 Because if you try to be everything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're going to end up being lukewarm tea。 And that is not a good brand positioning。
    Positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once you have the good brand positioning， that should determine what products
    you develop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And positioning is a strategic idea。 So you really want to think about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of what your target segment， what a customer's want， what your competition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what is your position relative， to the competition。 All of that is a big picture
    strategic vision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is distinct from messaging。 Messaging is tactical。 Once you have your brand
    positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can decide things like what color should the brand be， or what should the
    symbol be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or what should the logo be。 And we're going to talk about those in the third
    section。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of my part here。 But that's very much tactical and messaging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Positioning at the level-- I'm talking about it right here--， this is very much
    a strategic idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a very important piece of this， is this point of parity or frame of reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are-- so I want to spend a little bit more time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about this just so that you understand。 It's a part of the positioning
    statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's associations that are not unique to the brand。 They are these frame
    of reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are associations that are shared with other brands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you want to think about these points of parity， as things that are necessary
    for the category。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So something a brand must have to be considered， in this frame of reference。
    So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if your frame of reference， is a grocery store， then people， think in order
    to be a grocery store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it has to have produce or it has to have fresh product。 That's what a grocery
    store is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if it doesn't have that， it's not a grocery store。 So one of the things
    you think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of these points of parity， are what are the conditions that your brand
    must have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they share with the competition to be part of that set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you want to think about points of parity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes as ways to negate a competitor's point of difference。 So for example，
    in toothpaste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when one of the brands--， and I can't remember which one--。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first came out with fluoride and as a cavity preventer， and that was a differentiator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of the other brands copied and put fluoride in their toothpaste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suddenly it's a frame of reference。 It's a point of parity。 All toothpaste now
    has fluoride。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I've done is negated the point， of difference of the first innovator
    who came out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with fluoride toothpaste。 I have a slide up here on January 9， 2007， a few years
    ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Steve Jobs is still here， he used to go out on January。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and come up with some big innovation every year， and announcement about Apple。
    On January 9， 2007。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the big announcements at the time， was that he changed the name from
    Apple Computer to just Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now it's been a while。 And so people are very used to thinking about it
    as Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/91a90851d5e44de7bce85b35a3ee971e_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And probably many of you don't even remember it used， to be Apple Computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the point I'm making here is when， he changed the name of the company， think
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just for a second to see if you get this idea， which one of the three aspects
    of the brand positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: did he change？ Did he change the target segment？ Did he change his point of
    difference？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or did he change his frame of reference？ It should be clear， he changed his
    frame of reference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Target segments still create of young people， point of difference still innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now the frame of reference is not computers， but it's consumer electronics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I believe when he made this change， was the same time he introduced the
    iPhone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And he really was in consumer electronics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/91a90851d5e44de7bce85b35a3ee971e_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And it was no longer the frame of reference， comparing to other personal computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The point of difference， I think， is more clear to people， what that is。 It's
    strong， favorable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unique brand associations。 Some people talk about this as a unique selling proposition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a similar concept。 And what you wanted to do is to have it be sustainable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You want a competitive advantage， a point of difference， that you can hold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that is difficult for competition， to copy。 And it can be a lot of different
    things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be product attributes， performance attributes。 It can be imagery。 It
    can be benefits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be design。 It can be anything that you can own， and that really differentiates
    your brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you're choosing a point of difference， you want to make sure that it's
    desirable to the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it relevant？ Is it distinctive？ You also want to make sure that you can deliver
    these things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don't over promise。 Don't say something that's not feasible。 That's not sustainable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in choosing a point of difference， it's very， very critical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's probably going to be the reason people choose your brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you've got to make sure it's important， and that you can deliver on that
    criteria。
