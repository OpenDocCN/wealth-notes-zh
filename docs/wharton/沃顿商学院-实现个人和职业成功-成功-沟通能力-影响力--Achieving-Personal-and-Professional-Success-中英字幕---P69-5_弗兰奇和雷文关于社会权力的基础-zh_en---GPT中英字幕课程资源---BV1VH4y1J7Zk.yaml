- en: John Gardner puts it this way。 He says， "Leaders cannot maintain authority unless
    followers are prepared to believe in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that authority。"， In a sense， leadership is conferred by followers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not something that's demanded or taken。 Rather。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's conferred by those who would follow the leader。 If effort puts it this
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: formal authority is a source of power if and only if we accede。

- en: to it。 So， this raises the question， if obedience and the acceptance of authority
    is vital to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an understanding of politics， why do people obey？ Why and when do they accept
    authority？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best take on that and one of the first takes on this comes from French and
    Raven。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to sociologists who provide a classic model of the basis of social power and
    they enumerate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: five elements。 Reward power， coercive power， expert power， referent power， and
    legitimate power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This framework underlies much of the work in power and influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It provides one of the touchstone frameworks for our work。 Let's illuminate
    it quickly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A couple of them are rather intuitive。 Reward power and coercive power are exactly
    as you might expect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have reward power if you can provide nice things to other people， whether
    it's money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or non-monetary benefits。 Coercive， just the opposite if you're able to hurt
    them in some way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: French and Raven point out that these things don't necessarily go together in
    a formal， structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You tend to think people have both， if they have reward power， they have coercive
    power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can travel independently。 Some folks have reward power without having coercive
    and some coercive without having。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reward。 The other three are a little bit more involved so we want to unpack
    them a little bit and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll go back to D'Mello and look at ways in which D'Mello's behaviors show
    how these， things work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Expert power is mostly about confidence。 Performance and reputation based。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is about someone's functional status， someone knowing something you don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the reasons you see diplomas on doctors' walls， for example，
    any kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accreditation。 Herb Simon says that this is probably the principal type of authority
    that operates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in society in general。 It's that important。 Where do we see it from D'Mello？
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when D'Mello went into East Timor， the resistance leaders there had heard about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the UN in previous countries， they had heard， for example， that they had come
    in in Cambodia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and made a big mess， left a big trail and not really made any difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So D'Mello was very sensitive to this。 He knew that not repeating Cambodia meant
    aggressively establishing functioning government。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: structures that made a concrete and lasting difference to citizens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The emphasis there is the concrete and lasting difference that they had to go
    out and establish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a reputation for performance straight away。 A second notion is referent power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So referent power is an identification with or a feeling of oneness with or
    a desire for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that feeling with another person。 So being part of a group， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can give credibility or confidence to the like-mindedness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An in-group identification can make suggestions by others in the group more
    attractive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are all indications of referent power。 This is something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an interesting aspect of this source of power is that it's often outside。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the awareness of those who are influenced。 One can be under the sway of referent
    power without really understanding it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also outside the intentionality of a person who has it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A person doesn't have to want to be exerting referent power to actually have
    referent power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where do we see D'Mello with this？ Well， his emphasis on language you might
    think of as a way of cultivating referent power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He said， "How do you win the sympathy of the people？"， First， you have to learn
    the language。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Language is the key to a people's culture and culture is the key to a people's
    heart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you force them to speak your language， you will never win their sympathy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He knew this from his many years working in foreign countries。 It applies， of
    course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to language per se in countries， but you might think about it more， generally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if you're speaking English and you're a native English speaker， what does
    it mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to walk into an organization and speak their language？ Organizations have their
    own languages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Functional disciplines have their own language。 This is a lesson that we can
    take and apply in many situations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally， the fifth element of the French and Raven framework is legitimate power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Legitimate power is about what a person should， when they should obey or they
    ought to obey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or a leader has a right to。 It's all of those kinds of elements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This comes from the fact that most people in most situations are indoctrinated
    to "play。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: according to the rules of the game。"， This is not to say everybody all the time
    does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but there's a general inclination that， direction and there's this shadow that
    follows over that that says you're going to obey those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who are in positions of authority。 This is especially true in hierarchies or
    in societies which are more hierarchical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is intended to be something that's independent of the other sources of
    power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Independence of confidence， independent of the extent to which you identify
    with someone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: independent of the sanctions they may have， those in authority tend to be granted
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of legitimate power。 There is a kernel of rationale to this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a reason this holds in general。 Those who are higher in hierarchies
    are there for a reason。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've earned it in some way， so it makes sense to grant them the authority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe they have information that you don't have access to。 Again， it would make
    sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But French and Raven are underlining the fact that it happens independently，
    that it can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be overgeneralized from that。 Again， this is something that people don't necessarily
    know that they have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People in positions of power may not realize why people obey them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes it's merely the dent of the office they hold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DeMally was very sensitive to this kind of thing。 He very much understood the
    separation between formal power and informal power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He used participation as a source of legitimacy。 He knew that even though they
    were the UN。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this great worldwide organization that in， East Timor， their legitimacy was
    pretty weak actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The folks that they considered to be truly in power were the ones that had resisted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and basically created independence。 They had a very short rope and they had
    to build legitimacy in some other way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， colored the way he dealt with Guzman。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Guzman had earned that legitimate authority from the citizens and yet somehow
    DeMally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: had to move it from that military basis to more institutional， constitutional
    basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He had to balance acknowledging Guzman as the de facto leader and not enshrining
    him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before there was a way to formally build Congress and build a presidency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some subtleties in French and Raven， some details here that are worth noting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is that any use of power， especially the coercive element of power， can
    invoke opposing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: resistance。 It would be in your calculus on when you use these things to know
    that when you use them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they will invoke some kind of opposition， especially coercive power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea that these types of power differ in their degree of internalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rewards and punishment tend to be more temporal where the referent and the expert
    tend to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little longer lasting。 The idea which we stand repeating a few times here
    is that influence of power does not have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be intentional， many people don't understand the ways in which they have
    power outside。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of their intention just because of who they are or the offices that they hold
    or the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people react to them internationally。 And then finally this notion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a good caution for all of us。 The attempted use of power that is outside
    that powers range will decrease the power of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the authority。 This of course is going to put a premium on understanding where
    does your authority come。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from because you want to be able to use that authority but you don't want to
    overreach。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that authority。 So this is the framework from French Raven。 Again this is a
    good foundation for us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll see it in many places。 Even if you don't see it explicitly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's underlying much of the research out there。

- en: in power and influence。 These five elements as the bases of social power。 Reward
    power， coercive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
