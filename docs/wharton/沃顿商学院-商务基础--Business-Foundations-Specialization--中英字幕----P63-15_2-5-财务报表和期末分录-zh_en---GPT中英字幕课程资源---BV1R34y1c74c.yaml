    within the next year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to cash。
  prefs: []

    any prepaid。
  prefs: []

    which are obligations within the next year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and other， payables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then deferred revenues and other non-cash current liabilities last in， the
    section。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we'll have non-current liabilities。 These are liabilities that are due
    beyond a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So longer term bank borrowings and bonds。 And then other types of liabilities
    like deferred taxes which we'll talk about later。
  prefs: []

    so that we can do the cycle over and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Closing entries involve closing temporary accounts。 What's a temporary account？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's an account that accumulates the effects of transactions only for a certain
    period of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time so either fiscal quarter or fiscal year。 These would be the revenue and
    expense accounts which then get closed out to retained earnings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the end of the period。 Permanent accounts are the accounts that accumulate
    the effects of transactions over the life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the business。 These would be the balance sheet accounts like assets， liabilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: contributed capital， and retained earnings。 The actual closing entries are internal
    transactions that zero out temporary accounts at the end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the accounting period。 Again， by internal transactions we mean this is the
    accountant sitting at his or her desk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are not transactions with outsiders。 And the goal is to transfer the balances
    in the revenue and expense accounts and retained。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: earnings。 So the way the entries look is for revenues we want to zero out the
    revenue account。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Revenue accounts have credit balances so if we debit them we're going to zero
    them out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we credit retained earnings which moves the balance from revenue into
    retained， earnings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For expenses expenses have debit balances。 To zero them out we want to credit
    them so we credit expense accounts and debit retained。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: earnings。 And notice in both cases we're not creating any new stockholders equity
    we're just transferring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it from one type of account to another from the temporary accounts to the permanent
    account。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: retained earnings。 Then my grandpa tried to teach me accounting when I was five。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He said something about an income summary account as part of closing entries。
    Where is it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hey that happened to me also。 Yeah， there are still some textbooks that use
    income summary accounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a very temporary account and what happens is you close the revenue and
    expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accounts in the income summary and then you close income summary into retained
    earnings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the net effect being that there's only one entry that goes into retained
    earnings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instead of the two that we used in our approach。 But you get to the same place
    so it really doesn't matter which approach you use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like not using the income summary approach because it's just more straightforward
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not create a new account。 After the closing entries we do a post closing trial
    balance so we add everything up to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sure our debits equal our credits。 At this point only the permanent account
    should have balances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the revenue and expense， accounts should have a zero balance and now we're
    ready to start the next period。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sales of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sundries that's because relic spotters has two lines of business and so we want
    to highlight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the revenues from the two different lines。 Then we need the cost of revenue
    so these are like the product costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cost of goods sold of course matches up with the sundry sales but what was tricky
    is to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: figure out what's the cost of goods sold for rental revenue which is essentially
    a service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I decided was the direct cost of providing that service was the metal detector
    depreciation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expense and the software。 So included those in cost of revenue to get gross
    profit which is the markup over cost。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then below the operating income line we have interest revenue and interest expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't put interest revenue on the top line because our core business is not
    making loans。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're not a bank so we put it below operating income and then interest expense
    typically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    income tax expense and we have a net income of 2370。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    separated。
  prefs: []

    is part。
  prefs: []

    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To see how the closing entries work let's go back to our T accounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we look at something like rental revenue after we did our adjusting entries
    and of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the entry during the period there was a credit balance of a hundred and twenty
    four thousand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: four hundred。 What the closing entries going to do is debit rental revenue so
    that the balance is zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we look at advertising expense after doing the adjusting entry the balance
    was four thousand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that went on the income statement。 The closing entry is going to credit advertising
    expense for four thousand which will zero it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/42c8b0f1abf5889afee55fae61550c9b_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: out。 So we do that for all the T accounts and we get these two big whopping
    journal entries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for the closing entries for revenues we debit all the revenue accounts which
    is going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to zero them out and then we add them up and credit the balance to retained
    earnings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    them up and。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/42c8b0f1abf5889afee55fae61550c9b_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: then that's the debits retained earnings。 So if we go back over to our retained
    earnings T account here's the closing entry that transfers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the revenues into retained earnings。 Here's the closing entry that transfers
    all the expenses into retained earnings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now those expenses and revenues are going to live in retained earnings forever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can come up with a final balance for tain earnings which is a debit balance
    of one thirty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So even though we had positive net income we had more revenues than expenses
    we paid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that big dividend and the dividend was bigger than our net income so we have
    a debit balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have negative retained earnings。 That's okay remember retained earnings is
    one of the few accounts that can have it either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a debit or credit balance。 After posting everything to T accounts we can go
    back to our trial balance worksheet where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice for the permanent accounts you have the post closing balance is the same
    as the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    affected of course is retained earnings and then the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expense accounts are at zero and it was retained earnings was the only balance
    that was affected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by this process。 Now we're going to take all the balances of the permanent accounts
    and put together a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice a balance sheet is a point in time so we have December 31， 2012。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We start with assets and list all of our current assets in order of liquidity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    land building。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we subtract。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've always found this a little misleading because we're really not depreciating
    land。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it looks like we are but hey we've done this way for 4th century so who
    am I to complain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyway then we have the intangible assets like software and that will give us
    total assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For liabilities and stockholders equity we have the current liabilities so the
    obligations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    beyond a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
