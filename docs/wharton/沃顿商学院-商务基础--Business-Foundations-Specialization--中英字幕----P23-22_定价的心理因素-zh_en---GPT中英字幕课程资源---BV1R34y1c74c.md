Along with economics and statistics， psychology is another important aspect and we need to。

understand psychological aspects of pricing as we make pricing decisions。

Psychologists have studied pricing in great depth and there are many key findings。

Let's start with the first one which is very popular。 That's nine price endings。

In much of the US and many parts of the western world， you will see prices ending in either。

nine or five。 And there are many experiments and studies that have been done to illustrate the effect。

of nine price endings。 So here is one。 This is a very popular study that was done many years ago。

Price of margarine in a field experiment。 The regular price of margarine is 83 cents。

Unit sales is 2817。 What the price in the field experiment to 63 cents， sales increased by 194%。

So a 20 cent reduction in price increased sales by nearly 200%。

But the next four cents which is going from 63 to 59 increased sales by over 400%。

So what is this study trying to say？ The first 20 cents， even though it was larger。

had a much lower impact on sales than the， next four cents。

But the next four cents involved adding the price at 59 cents which is a nine ending。

So this is an example of a nine ending being effective in terms of increasing sales。

Here is another interesting study that has been reported in journals which is in a catalog， setting。

These researchers sent out in a catalog setting the same dress to different consumers but it。

was priced differently depending on who received the product or who received the catalog。

In one case the price was set at $34 in the other case at $39 and in the third case at， $44。

What you would expect is that the sales would be the highest at $34。 Why？

Because it's the lowest price。 What did this study find？

That the sales were higher at $39 as compared to $34。

One would expect sales at $39 to be higher than sales at $44 because 39 is lower。

But then you would have expected the sales to go up at 34 because 34 is lower than 39。

But somehow the nine ending is perceived as a sale。 So sales were highest at that。

So these two studies illustrate why nine endings often lead to higher sales than non-nine endings。

It is also case that there are many studies that have not found this effect。

But the practice continues because there is not much evidence to change this practice。

So we still continue to use nine endings and five endings especially in the United States。

Another very interesting psychological finding when it comes to price is we often refer to。

as the Weber-Fecner law。 I would put the word law in quotes because this is really not Newton's law or Charles。

law that we see in physics is more of an empirical generalization based on many studies put together。

So what did these two researchers find？ What they found was consumers reacted to prices more in percentage terms as opposed to absolutes。

So in simple words what does that mean？ What that means is a typical consumer will be happy to drive five miles to say five dollars。

in a product costing ten dollars。 But the same consumer will not be happy to drive the same five miles to say five dollars。

in a thousand dollar product。 Now if a consumer rational if you are willing to drive five miles to say five dollars it。

should not matter whether the product is ten dollars or product is a thousand dollars。

What we find empirically is that consumers are reacting more to a percentage price change。

as opposed to an absolute price change。 And you all you can look in your heart whether you will be consistent with the consumers in。

this study will you also be driving more likely to drive five miles to say five dollars in。

a ten dollar product versus five dollars in a thousand dollar product。

My sense is most of you will be consistent with what the subject in this study did。

Another very interesting effect that psychologists have found and is labeled as what we call。

as endowment effects。 It's a big word for something simple which is a sense of ownership increases the customer's。

willingness to pay。 I have often conducted this experiment in my class many times and it's just very simple。

I asked the students a very simple question I put them in this hypothetical setting that。

end of the course I will be distributing mugs and to one group of students I tell them you。

are fortunate enough to get the mug at what price will you be willing to sell it to someone。

who was less fortunate than you。 And to the other group I tell them you were not fortunate you didn't get the mug。

And I ask each of these groups a what will you be willing to sell the mug at that's the。

first group and the second group I ask them at what price what price will you be willing。

to pay for the mug。 And consistently what I find is that those who were put in the hypothetical situation that。

they own the mug are asking more for the mug than those who are willing to pay willing to。

buy the mug。 Even though both groups are told that the list price of the mug is 750。

What is also important here is to know that neither one of them actually has the mug they。

are just put made to assume that either they have the mug or don't have the mug。

So endowment effects don't rely on actual ownership but a perception of ownership。

So what are the implications the implications for this is make consumers feel they own the。

product before they buy。 So if you look at car test drives many years ago if you went for a car test test driving。

a car the usually the salesperson actually sat down with you and then was there with。

you all the time when you test drove the car。 These days when you test drive a car they just take your driver's license in many settings。

even though it's an expensive car they let you and your spouse drive the car on their。

own you just bring it back they know that you have to collect your driver's license anyway。

But what's the benefit？ A) they don't have the salesperson doesn't have to spend time but B) most importantly。

is you are in the car yourself without the presence of anyone it creates a sense of ownership。

and if the belief is that if you can create a sense of ownership people will be willing。

to pay more for the car or and therefore are more likely to buy it。

Another very interesting and powerful effect that psychologists have found is what we call。

as reference prices。 Most of us do not look at a price in isolation we compare it with some reference price we。

have in our mind and ask ourselves is the price we are going to pay today better or worse。

than that some reference price we have in our mind and most of the time these reference。

prices are based on the past history of prices。 So if I have seen higher prices in the past and today I am seeing a lower price I have。

a reference price in mind I compare today's price with that price。

Now how do you manipulate reference price one way you can manipulate reference price。

or increase it is by comparing your today's price against a list price or oftentimes you。

will see in an infomercial people will start with a very high price to create that as the。

reference price and then slowly go down to make it sound like a deal。

A very interesting effect that psychologists have found in terms of pricing is what they。

call as context effects。 What it really means is what is the impact of the choice set that is offered to a consumer。

on their mind decisions。 So look at two possible settings we have in one setting consumers go to a store and they。

see two cameras on the shelf。 One price at 169 and the other price at 239。

Think of another set of consumers who go to a store where they see three cameras on the， shelf。

One price at 169 other at 239 which is the same as the other consumers but one price。

much higher say at 469。 What do you observe in these cases？

What do you observe in these studies in a very robust way is that when you add the higher。

priced option consumers are more likely to gravitate towards the intermediate option。

Normally what you would expect is if I added a camera that is costing 469 much of its sales。

will come from the camera that was costing 239 as opposed to the camera that was costing， 269。

What do you actually find is the higher price camera draws more from the lower price camera。

and in fact oftentimes boost the sales of the intermediate option。

So in this case what you are seeing is something that you would not expect in a pure rational。

setting but we see this many times and this is really the foundation of what we call as。

companies offering good better best strategy。 What do you mean by good better best？

Instead of offering just two versions of a product good and better offer three versions。

of the product good better and best and more people are likely to buy the better version。

which is the middle version than the highest or the lowest version。

So if we reflect back on our module on pricing what do we conclude？

Effective pricing captures value and leaves as little as possible on the table。

It's not that hard to get that extra 1% once we know how to do these things better。

Price sensitivity is a major input into your pricing decisions and we learnt in this module。

what are the drivers of price sensitivity and we also learnt how to actually measure price。

sensitivity and price elasticity。 I think it's also important to keep in mind that consumers are not purely rational and。

incorporating psychological effects into your pricing decisions can also improve profitability。
