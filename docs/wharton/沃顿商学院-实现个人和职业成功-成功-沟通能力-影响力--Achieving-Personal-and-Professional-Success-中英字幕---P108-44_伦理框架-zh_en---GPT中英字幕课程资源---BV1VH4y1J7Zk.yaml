- en: Harvard Business Review。 How ethical or how unethical are you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things they first talked about is David Armour's work on the illusion
    of objectivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We tend to believe we are the objective ones in these situations that others
    might be biased。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're not biased。 That's a real problem because it can't be that everybody is

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an important and frankly easy check on your biases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the easiest prescriptions you can follow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was merely talk about things with other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a pretty bad sign if you're considering a course of action that you don't
    want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talk about with other people。 And one of the details here is that the more different
    the background。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the better。 It's not as helpful to talk about a challenging situation with a
    bunch of people who have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the same background as you， the same interest as you， the same training as you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're not apt to bring a much of new perspective。 But if you can get outside

- en: talk about it with people who might think about， it differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to be a more robust check on the rightness of your action。 And Obama。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"In these situations， we should have a bias towards operating multilaterally，
    as。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: opposed to unilaterally。"， Because the very process of building a coalition
    forces you to ask tough questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may think you're acting morally， but you may be fooling yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can't fool yourself if you have to convince other people to come onto your
    side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You really can't fool yourself if you talk about these decisions with other
    people。 Okay， finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the absolute category， these are things I do firmly believe in is the third，
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we went through the hard question survey， this is not， life is not a movie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are ways to be both effective and maintain integrity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too often when we read the books or see the movies or watch TV， characters get
    painted， as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， all good or all bad or effective， but evil and ineffective， but a
    good person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's not the way real life is。 Even if these things are kind of correlated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are ways to be effective and maintain， integrity。 It may be rare and demanding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but that doesn't mean it can't be done。 One of the things you need to help you
    along your way is to be vigilant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example。 It's helpful in life to have flesh and blood demonstrations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You carry around in your head of people who are living the way you want to live。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who have navigated difficult situations in a way that you would be happy
    to navigate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So difficult situations。 So we need to keep our eyes open for these examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but generally we need to cultivate， the inclination to look for third ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to not settle for these false dichotomies， to bring， some creativity into our
    ethical dilemmas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， three more from a category of consider this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are more personal but things to be considered。 They're at the very least
    examples of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: examples of ways of thinking about it that， you might use as you pull together
    your own framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first of these is have high standards for honesty。 It impacts not only what
    you say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what you do。 It is similar at the individual level as transparency is at
    the organization level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An organization which lives by transparency。 They're going to share， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with their employees salary information， performance， evaluations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the reasoning behind their decisions。 You might think about that as having all
    these downstream consequences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once they do that sharing， people act differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the interesting bit is that it also has upstream consequences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you know you're going to be that transparent or at the individual level，
    if you know you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: always going to be honest， you're not going to lie， it's not just that it has
    downstream。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consequences。 It changes your behavior upstream。 If you know you're going to
    have to tell your spouse that you did this thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well， you're， probably not going to do it。 Are you going to act differently？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or you're going to think about it more thoroughly at the very least。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It raises the bar and it removes cover that might lead you to take some bad
    decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As much of that as you can bake into your life， probably the better off you're
    going， to be。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this goes back to Richard Schills。 Are you willing to defend it in front of
    somebody？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not saying what you should do。 It's just that you shouldn't be doing things
    that you're not willing to defend in front。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of people。 Second， in this category， how consistent is your behavior？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might judge and act by considering in how many of our social circles would
    be comfortable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discussing it。 One way we lose our way ethically is that we fall into an organization
    or an industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that has a certain set of norms and there's nobody in that industry or in that
    company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or in that group that challenges those norms and you begin to think that all
    that behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is normal。 You're willing to talk about it outside of your social circle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're willing to be consistent， not just act one way here in a different
    way in a different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: social circle， it's going to provide a check for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also know that there are psychological consequences to having that kind of
    compartmentalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a toll it takes if you're acting so differently across your domains。
    Finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consider the trade-off between short-term and long-term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is often the case that the harder path to take is the one that is better
    in the longer， term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， the challenge here is that we're not guaranteed to be around in the long
    term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't know what the long term is。 There's a lot of uncertainty。 You may make
    the long-term play。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might make the wise move for the long strategy and then never make it all
    the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the long strategy。 We have to have our eyes open about that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if we want you to have not only influence but sustainable influence that
    typically calls。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: for play in for the long term， not being short term， not being expedient， sometimes
    sacrificing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gains in the short term in order to build that longer term influence， we're
    not interested。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in short-term influence in most situations。 What we're trying to help you do
    is build long-term sustainable influence。
