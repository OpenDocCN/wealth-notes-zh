- en: In this module， we talked about little slaw。 We used it to compute flow time
    given inventory。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and flow rate。 We computed inventory turns and inventory costs and we looked
    at the turnover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of employees。 In this last video of this module， I want to review the learning
    objectives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the key definitions and the key equations。 I will then give you some opportunities
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: practice this new knowledge on a set of very specific practice problems。 Let's
    start with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our module review。 So here are the learning objectives I hope I brought across
    in this， module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should now be comfortable using little slaw to compute one of the three
    performance， measures I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: R， and T given the other two。 You should be able to do the inventory turns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: calculation and the employee turnover calculations。 We have a bunch of new definitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More importantly， we also have a bunch of formulas including little slaw itself。
    Alright。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first practice， problem。 So this is a little slaw question where we have 25
    callers coming in per minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And on average， their callers spend one minute on hold and 3。5 minutes talking
    to a service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: representative。 Ask yourself how many callers are in the call center either
    on hold or talking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to an agent。 Put me on pause， wrestle with this by yourself， and then we'll
    do the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: together。 Alright， here we go。 So there are 25 callers arriving per minute on
    average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so that is our flow rate R。 And the average caller spends one minute on
    hold and 3。5 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking to the agent。 That's our flow time T。 So I equals R times T。 That's
    little slaw。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we now have R which is 25 calls per minute。 And we have the flow time
    of 4。5 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we multiply those two， then the minutes cancel out and it leaves us with
    an inventory， of 112。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5 callers on average。 Next up we have an inventory turns problem。 You'll see
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: following financial information here。 And I want you to find out the inventory
    turns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for this company。 Again， put me on pause now。 Alright， here's my shot at doing
    this。 Drop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the revenues。 Focus on the cocks。 The cost of goods sold， right？ The revenues
    are in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the question here to just confuse you。 I'm sorry。 The inventory turns is cocks
    divided。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the inventory。 So that is 1501 dollars per year divided by the inventory
    which is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expressed in dollars。 The inventory reset is 590。 And so this is not getting
    us 2。54 turns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: per year。 And the units are 1 over years because it's turns， not years。 It's
    turns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alright now to get to the inventory cost， we take the annual cost of inventory，
    the 15。25， percent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's per year。 Because you would incur if you held the inventory for an，
    entire year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you're not holding it for an entire year。 You're turning it 2。5 four， times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so divide this by 2。54。 And now you're applying this to the $85 of the item。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you multiply this by $85。 And this gives you roughly $5。1 per unit as a per
    unit inventory， cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alright， for the third and final practice problem of this module， we have a
    company with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a thousand five hundred employees on average。 And it recruits 500 employees
    per year。 And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want you to find the employee turnover and the average tenure of the employee。
    Clos me， now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what do we do？ There are a thousand five hundred employees on average。 And
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: average five hundred employees leave the company per year。 So the employee turnover
    is 500。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: employees per year divided by 1500 employees。 So that is giving us a one over
    three。 And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the units for that are one over years。 Again， it's a turn one over years。 That
    gives us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: already a hint on the tenure on when they leave。 That is a tenure on departure。
    On average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before leaving， they're going to stay for three years。 But that wasn't the question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I asked for the average tenure。 For the average tenure， we have to take these
    three years and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divide it by two。 Some will be just starting and some will just be finishing
    their time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the company。 On average， this is going to be 1。5 years。 Alright， that's
    all I have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0cf9dc6856918f96b45f0138921fffec_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: to say for now。 If you feel you're done， just get off the video。 If you want
    to hear another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little slow story， hang on for another minute or two。 A couple of years ago，
    I was at the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Philadelphia airport。 Those were the days before we had TSA pre-check-in。 And
    so all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: passengers had to go through the same line。 And believe me， it was a long line。
    So when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one day I arrived at Gate B for my flight to San Francisco， I was greeted by
    a TSA officer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who stood at the end of that long line。 The officer was friendly and professional
    and handed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: me a form。 This was a form。 As you can see， the form reads hello。 I'm a representative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the Transportation Security Administration。 TSA is a government agency responsible
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making your travel secure。 Please take this time-stand card and help us determine
    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long it takes you to get through the line。 It was a little time-stand on the
    back of the， card。 You。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that would have been me， you have been selected because you're the last person，
    in the line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thank you。 And then it goes on to say， please give this card again to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: line monitor at the beginning of the line。 And that's where we're going to time-stand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0cf9dc6856918f96b45f0138921fffec_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: it again。 And that allows us to compute how long you waited in line。 You get
    it？ They。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were measuring how long it takes me to go through security。 In other words，
    they measured。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my flow time。 What do you think？ Is this how you would have measured flow time？
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I didn't like it。 I had put on my professorial voice that I'm sure you now have
    grown sick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and tired of。 And I explained to this officer， "Look， look officer， why don't
    you simply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: count the number of passengers that are standing in line that gives you your
    inventory？ You。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know the flow rate， which is simply the number of passengers who are boarding
    the airplane， today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you use little's law to find the flow time。" Brilliant， isn't it？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least said this is what I thought。 The officer， I'm sure， had his own opinion
    on， that matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See you in the next module。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
