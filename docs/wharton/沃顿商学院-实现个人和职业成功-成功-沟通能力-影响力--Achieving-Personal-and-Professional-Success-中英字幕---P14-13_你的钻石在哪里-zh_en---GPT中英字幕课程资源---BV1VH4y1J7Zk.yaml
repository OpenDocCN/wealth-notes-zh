    standpoint。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll just give you a quick example from my own life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I told you I was on this long journey and I ended up living at home in the
    basement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a lot of things got ruled out by not good at numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But one of the things that was pretty good with words， so I checked off a bunch
    of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that I might be a teacher of and kind of came to the decision that law might
    be an option。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I could get into a law school。 So I went to law school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not because I was passionate about being a lawyer but because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I needed to make a living and I needed to get out of my house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what happened in law school in the first semester was what has led me to
    sitting in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this chair talking to you。 I was in one of the required courses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There were 150 people sitting in the classroom。 There was a teacher in front
    teaching about contract law。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all the students in the class were paying very close attention because this
    person who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was teaching us stuff was going to be on the bar exam and that we needed to
    pass in order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to get our diplomas。 So I thought it was focused。 And I realized I was sitting
    there and the professor asked a question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my hand shot into the air and I looked around and there were all these other
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with their hands up。 And I had this out of body experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I almost looked like I floated above all 150 students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I looked down on this whole scene and I realized what I actually wanted to do
    and be was the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: teacher in the front of the room having everybody on the edge of their seats
    waiting to hear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the question would be and what the answer was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that then flipped me to one level deeper and I realized that performing
    had been something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I loved to do ever since I was like five years old。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean in my little plays that we ran when I was a kid， I was the farmer and
    the farmer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the Dell。 I had the lead role in the fifth grade play and I loved it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I loved everything about it。 I love being the center of attention。 I love singing
    the songs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so this whole thing suddenly went aha。 The professor in the front of the
    room was getting a chance to perform。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wasn't a farmer in the Dell but it was an important subject that you can
    make a living， on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I began my quest。 Very simple from there on it was what do I have to
    do to get to be a professor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wasn't even sure what I had professed except it was something to do with my
    law degree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so from that little moment of insight inside my own diamonds I discovered
    my joy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in performing and how I could use that to become a teacher in a college environment
    and thrive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's that sort of thing that you might trivialize and say， "Oh well I was
    the lead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in my play when I was in fifth grade。"， But in there is the seed of something。
  prefs: []

- en: It may be that you like solving puzzles。 It may be that you were really good
    at helping people or being someone who cared for an elderly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those little seeds are still alive and all they need is a little water and they'll
    bloom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into a capability that will be incredibly powerful for you because they go all
    the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back into your genes。 And the evidence of it is how far back in your own life
    they go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's childhood interest， passions， capabilities。

    where the more skills you're able to put together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    then another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of those skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more likely it is that you'll thrive and become excellent at that skill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll give you an example。 Julia Childs， a famous celebrity cook from the last
    generation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    college。
  prefs: []

    but she couldn't。
  prefs: []

    up deciding to quit and she went off on a journey that。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we call it the CIA now but it was sort， of the security services and the defense
    intelligence services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so she got really good and realized she had a capability at aggregating
    lots of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and different perspectives。 Then she found her husband also during the war。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He happened to be a gourmet cook and introduced her to fine food and French
    cooking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They lived in Paris。 She found that she had a real aptitude for cooking。 So
    now notice what happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She's a good writer。 She's good at aggregating lots of data and now she likes
    cooking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as she began to put all these together， she was a pretty good writer， pretty
    good， cook。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pretty good aggregator but a cook who can write and aggregate data and put together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a really amazing world class cookbook that's written really well。 That's more
    unusual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So she then became a celebrity cookbook writer from putting these three things
    together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the final stage of her career was sort of an accident one day and she was
    living。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    had always liked to be the ham at the party。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She always liked to be the person who cut up and made jokes and was the sort
    of clown， of the party。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And she brought that instinct which is just another capability which standing
    alone is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: worth nothing。 And that to being someone who can cook and then you have a comedian，
    celebrity chef。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the first one in American culture and she became a legend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's what happens when you aggregate aptitudes which each one alone is
    nothing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: special but when you put them all together and you're doing something that people
    pay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you for that causes all four of these to work in harmony in a special circumstance，
    bingo。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that are genuine。

    good working。
