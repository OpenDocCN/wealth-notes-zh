  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: People often send us messages and we send other people messages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why don't we trust the messages people send us？ And how can we send messages
    that other people trust？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the idea is that we have to convey unobservable information。 So information
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how committed are you to this relationship？ Or how interested is this candidate
    in this career？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or how intelligent is this candidate？ Or is this partner really sure that this
    product is going to succeed？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're trying to make these judgments。 We're trying to trust other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we often have to rely on signals of these unobservable characteristics。
    So take， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how committed somebody is to a relationship。 What can they do to signal their
    commitment？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now often we think about things that have solved this problem like gifts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So somebody brings a dozen red roses。 That's a signal of commitment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're signaling that I care about you， I care about this relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what I want to do is I want to think carefully about signals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think about signals along two key dimensions。 The key idea here is that
    it could be clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Signals can be very clear。 And they can also be powerful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And by powerful what I mean is that this unobservable information is trying
    to be signaled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in some way。 Is that way too expensive for some types of people？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And is it too relatively inexpensive for others？ So when I said I want to signal
    that I care about you with a dozen red roses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's， clear。 Everybody gets that idea。 But what about power？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose that I don't really care about this relationship。 My aspirations perhaps
    are shorter term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I still afford to buy you a dozen red roses。 And the answer I want to suggest
    is that the answer is often yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is sometimes these signals are not very expensive。 And when we're checking
    signals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to think carefully in terms of power。 So here's some ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To signal that we're committed to relationships， it's expensive gifts that can
    solve this problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， we seem to have solved this problem too in relationships。 So
    roses are nice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but jewelry is better。 And if we're really committed to a relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have just the thing that's a diamond ring。 And notice what's nice about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're spending a lot of money and we have these rules of thumb for how much
    we should， spend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more money somebody makes， the more we should spend on that ring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that is it should hurt just enough。 It's expensive and costly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it should be more expensive and more costly the more resources， somebody
    has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So expensive gifts can help us solve the problem of should we trust someone's
    intentions？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are they really committed to this relationship？ And notice that it's the cost
    that really matters because we're spending money on characteristics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a diamond ring that are difficult to observe。 So how flawless the diamond
    ring is cut is difficult to assess with a naked eye without。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: training， but we care about those things because of the cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we can think about how committed is this person to this career？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How interested are they in working in my firm？ If they're willing to take an
    unpaid internship or if they're willing to spend a summer during。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: graduate school when they have few summers to spend， they're investing in that
    relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that career in a way that's expensive if they weren't really committed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now notice that sometimes people prepare for an interview。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they read five articles about the company。 They come prepared for the interview。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a clear signal of interest， but it's not a powerful signal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spending time interning is a powerful signal or we want to signal that we're
    intelligent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/59dd193fb206c9133be7ef540e30046c_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: How do we signal that？ Well， it turns out there's a costly and expensive signal
    for that and that's higher education。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we invest in education and we do that in a way that signals that were intelligent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we weren't so intelligent， it would be difficult to invest， watch all these
    videos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: read all these books， take all these tests。 It's too expensive for some types
    of people and it's less expensive for others who can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: afford it and reap the benefits of sending that signal or how surely this product
    will， succeed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Guarantees or warranties are things that help to send that signal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the idea is that when we send a message， we should be focused on clarity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is this message sending the right information？ So you show up and you have a
    dozen lowways for somebody that might not be sending a very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clear message。 We want to be thinking carefully about how clear is the message。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is somebody receiving it going to get the idea？ And the second is towards power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when people send us messages， are they sending messages， these signals that
    are expensive？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of my friends for example is working at a company on one of his work anniversaries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He received a basket of flowers and with his basket of flowers was a note， we
    care about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you and your commitments， this organization。 We really value what you do。 A
    week later he was fired。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now could the company afford to send messages like the one in that flower basket？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my answer is yeah， of course， they can afford to send that even if they
    don't really， mean it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So sometimes we can send messages that aren't very powerful and as receivers
    we should be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: checking that power。 So in terms of guidelines， send signals that are clear。
    In terms of receivers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we should trust signals that are powerful and they can be powerful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of time as well as money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/59dd193fb206c9133be7ef540e30046c_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So if somebody is limited in time， so a CEO has a limited number of lunch appointments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: spending a lunch with you or calling you on a Christmas day， there's a limited
    budget of， time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can think about the power in terms of both time and money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But those are the two key key dimensions。 Clarity won't particularly when we
    send signals and power particularly when we receive signals。
