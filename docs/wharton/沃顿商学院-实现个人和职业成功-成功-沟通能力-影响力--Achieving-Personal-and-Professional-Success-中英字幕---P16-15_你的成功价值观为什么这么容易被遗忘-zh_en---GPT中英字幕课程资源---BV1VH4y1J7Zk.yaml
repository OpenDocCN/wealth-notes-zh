    basis every week。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    teaching。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the same is true of success values that you devise for yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are four different ways that I want to talk about how you can help yourself
    remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what your success values are and each of them is both a journey of your imagination
    as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as sometimes a journey back to the past。 People have a couple of assessments
    that will help you think about these and the first of。
  prefs: []

    think。

- en: and images and the most frequently used image or metaphor for success is a ladder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ladder is so ubiquitous as a metaphor for success that people often forget
    that that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what they're actually working with and simply start speaking in terms of this
    metaphor and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're completely unconscious of it。 So people talk about getting to the next
    step in the ladder of success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They talk about getting to the next level。 They talk about climbing metaphors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They talk about where they are on the ladder。 And basically the ladder is a
    metaphor for status。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And status is an important part of the outer life so it's not irrelevant to
    success but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have to understand the limits of a metaphor if you're going to be able to
    take some ownership。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and control over it。 So take a look at this picture of a ladder and a person
    climbing it and see if you can figure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out any limits that this picture implies。 There's something missing from this
    picture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's something that feels incomplete about this image as a sort of metaphor
    for a successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: life。 When I conduct programs for executives and students and I show this image
    very often people immediately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: identify a number of things。 We'll see how many of them that you picked up on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First there are many ladders。 And so which one is this person on and why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think it's the case that the image of a ladder is pretty arbitrary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have just started up a ladder at some point in your life and you stop
    thinking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the other options that you might have explored and simply just keep climbing
    the one you're， on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when you look at it from a little bit of a distance you may appreciate that
    maybe the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: best move for this person is to actually climb down the ladder there on and
    to move to another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one that might be more suitable for them。 People also notice that the ladder
    just sort of ends and what happens when you get to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: top。 There's no， the metaphor doesn't help you much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You get to the top of your ladder what are you supposed to do next？ Doesn't
    have any continuity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So maybe you're supposed to jump to another one or maybe you're supposed to
    like wave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at people and celebrate yourself。 But nothing much there in the metaphor to
    help you with that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then most importantly probably people tend to eventually notice that this
    person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is all by themselves。 And there's just one person climbing a ladder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think if you think about your own life for even a short amount of time
    you'll realize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that this is a fundamentally false image of how life works。 Nobody ever does
    anything alone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You began in a family of some sort。 You lived in a community。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You went to schools where teachers were helping you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have mentors and coaches and all the other people that have kind of bolstered
    you along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way and energized you and motivated you and helped you find your direction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And none of those people are in this picture。 So if this picture were going
    to be a little more realistic you would have this throng。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of people all around this person climbing， cheering and providing help and different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: step ladders to get to that point in the ladder and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's really important to remember the social context of any kind of satisfying
    human life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this image does not have any of that。 So maybe the ladder is not such a
    good metaphor。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So another common metaphor is a race。 We certainly a lot of students that come
    to the Wharton School are very competitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They want to win。 They won the race in high school。 They've won the race。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they're MBA students they've won some sort of race in college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're trying to win a race to find the best jobs and employment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And many people model success as essentially victory winning。 And there's nothing
    wrong with that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Competitive energy is really powerful。 If you can channel it well it can get
    you up in the morning and add some zest and urgency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the activities that you engage in and give you and make it kind of fun。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So not saying competition is bad。 Again if you take a look at this picture as
    a metaphor and take two steps back and look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at it you may notice there's some problems with this as a theory of success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the overriding theory that you might want to base a life on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again when I show this to executives and students almost immediately they recognize
    that for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: someone to win a lot of people had to lose。 And so is that really necessary
    condition of your success that you defeat and beat a bunch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of other people。 And many people when they think about it say well not really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like winning but it doesn't have to be that others lose in order for me to
    win。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's another problem of course with this。 It's similar to the latter problem
    and that is which race do you choose to be in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you're a myler or you're a marathon runner or you're a sprinter you better
    pick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the right race to use your personality to use your skills， your endurance， your
    passions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or you're going to find yourself being very frustrated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So picking the race is important and then finally if you don't have some perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on competition and all you do is win at any cost you're going to destroy a lot
    of relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're going to leave a lot of people injured and you're going to create a fair
    amount of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: resentment around you and that's really not the optimal conditions for a successful
    life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/cdc7517f0ed22121b0e8bf22fca49e41_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So you have to have a perspective where the winning is something that's more
    of a game。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes you win， sometimes you lose。 The people you're racing with are equally
    engaged and have an equal attitude that it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more for the fun and for the energy than it is for any comment on their worthiness
    as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a human whether they win or lose。 So add those dimensions to this metaphor and
    maybe it begins to be helpful but you can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see if you're not aware of the fact that you're motivated almost entirely by
    a metaphor of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: winning it can get in your way and you can find yourself in places you don't
    want to， be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So another metaphor I'm just going to give you three because really your problem
    is to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: find one for yourself just want to inspire you with a few different thoughts
    on how people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about this。 It's this image。 It's a pond and someone's just dropped a
    pebble into it and as a result there are these concentric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: circles that are spreading out from the source of the impact of the pebble in
    the pond。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this might be an image for someone who thinks of success as the number or
    the measure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of positive influences that they're having on the people around them and that
    every positive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influence they have on someone then creates a condition for that person to have
    a positive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influence on someone else。 And so these rings can spread pretty far if you set
    in motion a positive influence by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: helping， mentoring， providing information or inspiration， being able to comfort
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when they're suffering or when they're down and bringing them to a place where
    they can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come back to be more productive again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/cdc7517f0ed22121b0e8bf22fca49e41_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: A little different than a ladder， it's not like you're going up or down， you're
    just， spreading。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a lot more energy implied in this continuous motion than just winning a
    race and then lying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: down exhausted because this energy kind of renews itself， it builds on itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So over the years as I've taught this subject to many different audiences and
    I've had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've taught to public school teachers， to people in public safety， to people
    who are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in healthcare organizations and I challenge them and I'm challenging you to
    think of a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: metaphor that works for you。 Something thoughtful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something that embodies who you are and what you are at your best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think a good metaphor for success helps you remember your goals because you're
    able。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to think to yourself。 Am I in the right spot？ Am I doing what I should be doing
    because I can feel the coherence between my activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: today and the metaphor for success that I've created for myself？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people have suggested an image of a compass to help people find their direction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: High school track coach once suggested that a compass was the metaphor he liked
    to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The person who was a preschool teacher said that her image of success was a
    big shade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tree in Africa where the village can come beneath the shade tree and create
    community。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and renew itself and be sheltered from the sun。 And that was what she was identifying
    as the place she ought to be and why she did what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she did。 So， you know， your challenge， find your own metaphor。 Write it down，
    think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talk to your friends about it， talk to your loved ones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about it and see if you can refine it a little。 That actually segues to the
    second tool for remembering and renewing your theory of success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is your social experience。 The people that you choose to surround yourself
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you choose to surround yourself with people who don't hold your values，
    who resist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or compete with your values or who minimize them， it's easier， much easier to
    forget。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what those values are and basically get lost in the values that the social group
    you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a part of endorses。 So I think it's really helpful to be quite self-conscious
    about choosing your social。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: group so that it's a reinforcing experience for your values and not something
    that compromises。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your values。 You know， when you were a kid， your parents probably wanted to
    be sure you were hanging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out with the right people。 And part of the reason they cared about that was
    not just your safety。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they wanted， you to hang out with people who would have values that they
    endorsed as the leaders in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the family。 And now that you're outside your family circle， you get to make
    those choices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's important that you pick your social circles wisely。 First Donald， in
    one of his books。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it's a subject that we talk about in the success， course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually define three kinds of friendships。 And I think this can be a pretty
    good diagnostic for how you're doing with your friends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The three types of friends that Aristotle mentioned were friends of pleasure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically these are people that you like to have a good time with。 Friends of
    utility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and these are friends that you engage with to get your work done or to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: advance some outer goal that you have。 And both of those kinds of friendships
    are very helpful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can provide you with a good social network。 But the real payoff as Aristotle
    sought for a social relationship is to find and cherish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what he called your friends of virtue。 And a friend of virtue is someone who
    really wants what's best for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Someone who when you're around them， it brings out the best aspects of you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're the people who can gently offer you reminders of your most important
    values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: give you a little coaching if you begin to stray from those values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But also resonate with and embody themselves the same virtues that you honor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how many friends of virtue do you have？ Not very many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They tend to be people who you went through a very important part of life with，
    who know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you when you had a crisis or a conflict and they've stuck with you through a
    transition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you know their story， they know your story。 They're people who you renew
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's a good test of a friend of virtue。 And my experience is you haven't
    seen them for a while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you call them， and as soon as， the conversation starts， you pick it up right
    where you left it off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You understand each other that well。 There's no need to go back and do chit
    chat and feel the formality of renewing a friendship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of utility and asking how their jobs are or something like that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You each know what the most important issues are that you're working on in your
    lives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you pick up with a piece of that as part of the background of how you're
    relating to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one another。 So maybe you， different people have different social capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but maybe you have three or， four friends of virtue in your life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They could be your parents or one of your parents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They could be a childhood friend or a classmate from college that you happen
    to room next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to your freshman year。 And then you've stayed in touch with them ever since。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe they're your spouse。 I think if you have a friend of virtue who's your
    life partner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's a pretty special， combination to go through life with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So surround yourself with people that renew and remind you of the values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a second very important tool。 Third is to remember and renew your sources
    of personal self-confidence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We all have days when we go up and days when we go down and when we're down，
    we lose our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: self-confidence。 We are basically losing confidence in the underlying success
    values that we have come。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to endorse and we begin to feel that life doesn't have the same meaning or direction
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: energy as it did。 And so everybody has this happen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you renew that source of self-confidence that will get you back and in
    motion in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: direction that you know is best for you？ I've got an exercise that we use in
    the success course that I want to make available。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to be available for you to download and take。 And it's really a pretty
    simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thoughtful thing to engage in。 In the course we talk about a Roman emperor named
    Marcus Aurelius。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Marcus Aurelius lived about two or three hundred A。D。 He was a great general。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He spent a lot of his time fighting wars up in France for the Roman people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But he was also a philosopher。 And one day he started a journal and he kept
    writing it and ended up being a document he。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: called "To Myself。"， And it was basically a diary。 And the very first entrance
    in this diary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he laid out all the people in his life so far， who had endowed him with a legacy
    that had contributed to his success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He talked about an uncle， he talked about a teacher， he talked about his father，
    he talked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about his mother。 And each of the important qualities that each of these people
    had sort of handed off to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: him and that had allowed him to become a thoughtful person who was able to sort
    of consider his。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: own life and have a meaningful one。 We call it the legacy exercise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think if you take a look at it in between the sessions that we're sharing
    together， what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll see is a whole set of lessons about life。 How to love and be loved。 How
    to set goals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How to express gratitude。 All these different things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what I challenge you to do is think of the person in your life who endowed
    you with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the knowledge of that virtue or that practice that allows you to be successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And take a moment to remember a story about that person， to bring them into
    your memory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and feel a little grateful for what it is that they've given you。 And cumulatively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you think about all of the assets that these people have given you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what tends to happen is your self-confidence begins to return。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because you realize that you've got a lot more going for you and others have
    basically given。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you a lot of gifts to help you get along。 And so the legacy exercise can be
    a great way to renew your self-confidence by thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about how you came to be the person you are。 Just an extra credit step on this。
