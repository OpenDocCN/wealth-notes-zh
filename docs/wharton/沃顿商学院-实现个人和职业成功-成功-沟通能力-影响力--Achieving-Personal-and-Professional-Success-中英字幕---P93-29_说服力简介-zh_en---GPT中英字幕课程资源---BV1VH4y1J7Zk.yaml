    of colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of mine， Yuri， Simon， and Joe Simmons， about some research they've done recently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: The final title on a subject that seems a little arcane and yet this paper has
    been wildly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influential。 It's been cited 2，000 times since it was published in 2011。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's arguably the most influential paper in what has been called the reproducibility
    crisis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in psychology。 And it raises a question， did persuasion have any role to play
    in the impact this paper。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: is having？ You might think academic research is a place where persuasion shouldn't
    matter。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's why I wanted to talk to Yuri and Joe because you think this is a place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where it doesn't matter to his ideas。 But it turns out these guys put a lot
    of thought into rhetoric and persuasion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we sat down with them recently to find out how it went down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're here this afternoon to talk to Yuri， Simon， and Son and Joe Simmons，
    both professors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that they've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: been doing for the last， what fellas， six or seven years now？ Because back a
    little？ Six years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Six years on what they initially called false positive psychology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they published a paper in 2011 which as of last count has something like
    2，000 citations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reproducibility。 Some people will call the reproducibility crisis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And others have had voice in this obviously。 But the paper and the research
    and the ongoing program has been influential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're here to talk today about persuasion， the role of persuasion and rhetoric
    in that， effort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the motivation is that we talk about persuasion all the time and other domains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We talk about it in marketing or politics inside a firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we don't usually think that something like science would involve persuasion
    and rhetoric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My sense of having been around you guys in this project for most of that time
    is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: persuasion has been an important part of it。 And so I thought it'd be good and
    instructive for us to talk a little bit about it and hear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of from the inside how you've thought about that and what your experience
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: persuasion and rhetoric has been in this domain。 This was a paper that we really
    needed people to read and pay attention to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Otherwise there's no point at all in doing it。 We were trying to change how
    the field as a whole did research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so for the first time in my life I was involved in a big persuasion attempt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we really did think hard about how on earth to get people to read this
    paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most people don't read papers that are part of academics。 Even academics for
    sure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most papers do not get read。 So we're going to talk in a lot of detail about
    this research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might be useful to explain in a very short fashion what the enterprise was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what exactly were you trying to persuade people to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know that's a ridiculous question but it's concise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/62b30b944513b40130cbd22cc1ee1775_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So I basically change how people conduct and report the research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/62b30b944513b40130cbd22cc1ee1775_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So the idea is people have， when you conduct a study you collect many measures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example you may ask people how they feel about something that you may ask
    them how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much they would be， how hard they would work to obtain it。 You may ask them
    multiple ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then so they if you collect all those measures and you get to choose from
    them， the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: results report are going to be biased towards the one that works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine you try a drug and you give it to 100 patients and you see if it
    helps with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: weight or with their heart condition or with their skin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then if you try enough of those things one of them will work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you report your results and you only talk about the one that actually
    worked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other measures will be made lead into thinking that is very persuasive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very compelling evidence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/62b30b944513b40130cbd22cc1ee1775_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: when in fact is just chance。 So this is an important feature here that this
    is basically a methodology paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's not just persuasion and rhetoric in a scientific endeavor but it's scientific。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: methods and so we're really getting into what I think most people would think
    is pre-dry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: technical area not much room for persuasion。 So how did you position this paper？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How did you argue in this paper in a way that was different from other attempts，
    other academic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attempts？ I mean we were writing a methods paper and most methods papers are
    written for methods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people and we didn't want to write a paper for methods people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wanted to write a paper for normal people， normal academics at least。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we had the advantage of being normal academics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/62b30b944513b40130cbd22cc1ee1775_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So a lot of methods， people writing methods papers are methods people but we're
    not a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: methods people so we sort of understood like what would it take for us to read
    a methods， paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we tried to build a methods paper that we ourselves would want to read。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we started out by putting simulations in our paper because that sort of showed
    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: big the problem was but I think the big insight was that a paper that just contains
    simulations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is not a paper that many people are going to read。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we thought long and hard many many conversations around what is a good
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or demonstration of the problem。 And we tried to come up with a demonstration
    that was interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of cute， maybe， people would talk about it， you know that sort of thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think that's sufficiently cute you should tell us real quickly just to describe
    it at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a high level。 So we basically wanted to show that scientists could find statistically
    significant evidence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for any hypothesis no matter how absurd。 And so we came up with a hypothesis
    that was demonstrably absurd which is that listening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to a particular song can change how old you are。 And no one on earth believes
    that's possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we ran a study using the norms of the day that basically showed that
    that effect， was true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We were like look if you do things the way that they are currently being done
    you can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: find evidence for this crazy hypothesis and you can write it up in such a way
    that people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would be scientists would be persuaded by it。 And so we thought that piece was
    I think absolutely critical if we hadn't done that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not sure we would have gotten published but even if we had gotten published
    it would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have probably been ignored。 That was one aspect of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in terms of the persuasion thinking about it we would picture our least methodologically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: oriented friend and ask what would get this guy to tell about this paper to
    his friends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would the paper need to contain so it becomes like viral for academic standards？
    Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And where did that nucleation come from？ Is that a way you would thought about
    your work or your teaching or why that pivot from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way you might typically write？ The goal we said when we first met to discuss
    this we said okay so we want to change how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: psychologists do science and that felt like an impossible goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the first step in persuasion people have to listen to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I guess we were just very aware of how common it is for people to complain
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a problem in academia and be ignored for decades and decades。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the first step for not being ignored is people need to know what you
    said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think at least introspecting that's what I think of you。 No， yeah absolutely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first piece was basically getting people to want to read the paper by
    making it interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe even a little funny in places， stuff like that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the second piece was about you can't just complain， as Yuri was just saying
    you can't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just complain about a problem。 You also have to propose a solution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Otherwise people just keep walking around complaining about it and nothing will
    ever get， done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you also have to produce a solution that is actionable and easy and really
    hard to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: argue against。 And so that was the other element of the paper that we really
    strove for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other people around that time or shortly thereafter were writing similar type
    pieces。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the solutions on offer were utopian。 In fact some people even used the word
    utopian。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they were not at all practical。 And they weren't going to happen any time
    soon and probably not in our lifetime and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: probably not ever。 And so we were trying to think instead of what could journals
    or what could scientists do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tomorrow to change how they're doing it。 And so we really tried to find a baby
    step that would actually work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually be impactful， and that was sort of hard to argue with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So those are sort of the two elements we really focused on。 Almost all of our
    conversations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean the science of it was figured out in a day or two， or something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost all of our conversations with this paper were about how to persuade。
    Wow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the paper itself is actually quite short。 It's like nine pages and two or
    three of those are these prescriptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long list of prescriptions。 But obviously the persuasive effort goes beyond
    the publication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You then go out and or even before the publication you're out talking about
    the paper， you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: visiting schools， you're giving talks。 What， how did you find yourself going
    about that differently than you had before？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think we're， we didn't， that we did not alter very much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We did what we always did except that this time it was an incredible amount
    of demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to hear us talk about it。 So we， we submitted a symposium to a conference which
    is something everybody does all the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time you say， here's three papers， please let us talk about it。 And they said，
    okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And usually 20 people show up， 50， maybe 100 people show up。 We had like 800
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's like standing room only。 And that was， it's not like we prepped for that。
    It just happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think it was， it was really just the downstream consequences of having
    drafted the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: message in the paper appropriately。 But did you， did the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that must have been reinforcing in some way？ So you， you， you had this pivot
    to thinking in a more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about rhetoric more explicitly。 I'd be surprised if you didn't bake
    that into some of your presentations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Did you not spend extra time more than usual working on just the right example
    or just the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right analogy？ I feel like you guys are always coming up with these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these analogies that are just so， apt。 Yeah。 I mean， I， I practiced like crazy
    for that talk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For sure to try to make sure all the words were right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I think that was less of a concern about coming up with the right example
    in the talk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because basically we were using the example from the paper。 So that wasn't really
    the issue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was more about， you know， in my class on decision making， I talk about motivated
    reasoning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how， you know， people are more likely to believe something when they want
    to believe， it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a big implication of that is they don't， they're more likely to believe
    you if they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like you than if they dislike you。 If we come out at the symposia and start
    talking about， hey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you guys are all doing this wrong， and you know， we're better than you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we come out swinging like that。 That's terrible and if， and false。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because we had been doing all of the things that we， pointed out in the paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can look at some of the garbage that I published prior to 2011。 It's， it's
    terrible stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we were also very cognizant of the language was about we as a field and
    in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: paper and in talks， we'd emphasize how we had all done these things。 And now
    all of us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: including us， now need to change the way we're doing things because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you don't want to get on your high horse。 People are going to hate that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beyond just the first paper， you're also very well known for work on P curves。
    And in that paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you came up with this term P hacking。 You've coined a few phrases now that people
    know well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: false positive psychology was the， title of the first paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This term researchers degrees of freedom。 What role do you think getting the
    right terms or titles play？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'd like to think as academics， come on， this shouldn't matter， this is superficial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it kind of feels like it mattered here。 I feel like it matters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It allows conversations to more naturally flow。 I've had a couple of experiences
    where I've really struggled in a slightly different stream。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of research， really struggled putting forward the ideas in a way that rests
    on with people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I just， what if I just call it something that， that， so instead of
    saying， I knew a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: approach to a value in a replication。 And I play with like 10 different iterations
    of those words in different order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I said， oh， actually， this is really analogous to having a small telescope。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I really branded the paper the small telescopes problem and it immediately
    became a much easier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: idea to convey。 When you want to talk about that paper， you say the small telescopes
    paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you don't， have to say the paper or assignments with this thing and it becomes
    like a two sentence thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I get that entirely。 But I also have been aggravated for years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We all have been by researchers who are forever naming things， kind of unnecessarily。
    It seems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even well known researchers sometimes forever want to came up with new heuristics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're going to name something。 How would you characterize a successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: effective attempt at naming something new versus kind， of a superfluous， which
    is something we see？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know， so it's not just go give something a new name。 You have to do it in
    some thoughtful way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it'd be hacking， for example。 It came after-- so the first paper， the full-spotted
    one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: used researchers' research of research， of freedom。 And we used that， I don't
    know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say 10 times。 But then for the following paper， we had to use that every
    other paragraph。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it just didn't seem sustainable to use research of research of research
    of freedom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a hundred times。 And we don't like acronyms。 We didn't want to have RDFs everywhere。
    And so we said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need a word。 And so it was really， there's a concept in need of a label。
    Let's find the label。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're supposed to， let's create an artificial need for a label so that we can
    become famous。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or something。 OK。 So I think that--， Which is the way it feels sometimes。 Yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes it feels like， well， this is really similar to what if I call it different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe we perceive it as different。 That's not-- I don't think I would ever give
    for that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Absolutely not。 But if you have a concept that you have to repeat， and every
    time you repeat it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you， have to define it， like basically the term is a definition of the term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's when you need a word and a term。 What missteps have you made？ You guys
    have had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're part of a broader effort， of course， big impact。 So you've done lots
    right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you think there are any places that you've missed or that you would have
    done differently？ Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Absolutely。 Such a chance。 So early on， we would get-- because we had zero experience
    on this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ So we were-- we had seven years of experience as researchers， but zero
    as persuaders， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so when people would push back and say， engage in personal attacks， questioning
    our， integrity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or just any criticism of what we're saying， the facts in a very public arena。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it felt like an imperative to immediately and forcefully respond very emotionally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just because it felt wrong to do it。 And we did。 And at least I would not do
    that anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So first of all， it is okay for people to have wrong beliefs that they express
    publicly about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your work。 You don't have to respond to all of them。 And then if you do respond。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's fine for you to remain cool。 There's almost no downside to taking the higher
    moral ground。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We were talking about this intuition。 I can't remember where we got it from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where the better it feels to say something， the， probably the worst it is for
    you to say it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a great year。 And unfortunately， I don't know what it comes from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we're writing something， if it feels great to say it， we try to erase
    it。 You've written。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: argumentation and science。 Because you guys have been in this debate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you've kind of learned some do's and don'ts。 What else would you say is important？
    Yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that's immense planning。 That's why he's not a term， exactly。 Yeah， that
    didn't go on。 Not yet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least。 So I think we're three principles。 I'll see if I can remember them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One was to not assume you know the intentions of your counterpart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very common for people who are criticized to think they know the intentions
    of the other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: part and that those intentions have not been on。 So it's a personal attack for
    jealousy or for political reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the point is， it's not like there's never， of course there's some attacks
    or personal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you don't know as a recipient of a criticism why it comes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's irrelevant because the criticism is right or wrong and if it's wrong，
    but for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the right reason it doesn't matter， it's still wrong。 So don't pay attention
    to that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other one was like reaching out。 So if you're going to discuss somebody
    else's work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: send them a draft and ask them what， they think。 It's fine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not about this and to them this would be impossible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's immoral for you to share your story with the person you're describing before
    you publish， it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we have a blog and we do it and it's amazing。 To be clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's immoral because of the rules of journalism。 The rules of journalism。 Objectivity，
    presumably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's right。 They feel like they'll be compromised。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't really buy the argument because it's not like you tell them， okay， you
    write it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up and I'll publish for you， send me。 I'll feed back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so often people get upset with journalists or with bloggers or with scientists
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they feel they've been mischaracterized。 And it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: almost every time we share the draft of a blog post where we discuss somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: else's work with them， they get incredibly upset about the tiniest thing that
    you couldn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: care less about changing。 And you change it and they feel like you've seated
    a lot of ground and you feel like the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: piece is indefinetrable from what it was like。 So by the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that seems to connect to that quote about you rarely change someone else's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mind without changing your own。 So you're talking about， it's a form of negotiation
    almost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You give just a little bit but it feels great to them and it helps in the persuasive
    effort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: essentially if you can give a little bit。 And then there was a third principle
    in Minch Splaining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah， the third principle is described only able。 So don't， so for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you're going to say something is， if you feel something's， wasteful and you
    call it wasteful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all you're really saying is， I don't like it。 You're not really helping the
    recipient of the message understand why you find it wasteful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And once you've explained what you find it wasteful， you don't really need a
    label anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because anybody who reads your description will incorporate that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you almost never need to tell the recipient what you think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're just interested in why you're thinking and they'll figure it out。 For
    my experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it makes messages much more difficult to counter。 Especially because terms can
    be so loaded and so easy to be interpreted in the wrong way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially if you are the person who's being thrown into the term out。 And Yuri。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you just apologize for doing exactly this thing。 I mean you wrote this piece
    and then within the year you violated your own principle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then you also kind of confess to it straight away and say this is。 Well，
    you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's very natural to feel good， to want to feel good with what things， you say，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's like when you throw the punch that second feels great。 Right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is there a rest of your life that you regret it？ But that instantly feels great。
    Right， right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right。 Anything else fellas？ Anything else about rhetoric and persuasion you
    think we haven't touched on that's especially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: important or that you've learned along the way？ I mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just related to what Yuri was just saying is I think he's a million times better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than I am at all the stuff he was just suggesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think we've also really benefited from being a team of three。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lafe Nelson is also part of our team and he's at the University of Berkeley。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a team of three is sort of for us I think is being critical because there
    are times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when two of us get very worked up and emotional and want to respond to an email
    in a certain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way or want to post something online in a certain way that violates these kinds
    of principles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's almost always at least one of us who has the cool head and we always
    check。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the other two before doing anything。 And so it's especially for me it's
    really been helpful over the years because I could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have if I was doing this on my own because I'm a more emotional person and basically
    I'm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a bigger idiot is what I'm saying。 I would have probably done a lot of damage
    to the cause。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But do you eventually start internalizing some of those voices and perspectives
    having worked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in that group and Lafe importantly great let's recognize Lafe as well but having
    worked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with Lafe in the years as close as you have for these years at some point you'll
    never。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not need them at all but do you need them a little bit less？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean yesterday we wrote something we sent it to Lafe and said isn't this great？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was like no you really don't want to send that。 And so we turned this page
    long email into a very polite sentence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so it's hard because when you're experiencing the frustration or the anger
    it's just really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hard to。 The best you can do is have policies like I write emails and then I
    don't put the person's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: name in it who I'm directing it to so I don't accidentally hit send and then
    after I write。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it I'm like that's going to feel really good to send and then I save it or I
    forward it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to them and ask if I can send it and 100% of the time they would say no you
    cannot send。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it or I would not send it to them and realize two days later that of course
    you can't send。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you need to sort of calm down。 These are policies like my experience of
    this stuff unfortunately has not changed so the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: misery is still there of dealing with this kind of stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know it's not that different from over buying or over eating when you're
    hungry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just a very it's a it's emotional drive。 Is that visceral？ Yeah it's a
    visceral reaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a very basic instinct of expressing your anger when you experience it。
    Yeah I sort of feel bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's lots of people in the field who have weighed in on these arguments and
    they've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: made some people have made just massive missteps by posting things online and
    I feel like they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going at it alone so like they don't have the person like whispering their ear
    or chaining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them to the floor you know telling them not to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we've had the benefit of at least having the three of us and I don't
    want to say that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think there have been times where even all three of us sort of together did
    the wrong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thing but but it's way way less frequent than otherwise would have been if we
    if we had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the good。
