- en: in the last session。 To them， lean operations is all about making the resources
    more protective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how do you make a resource like a doctor more productive？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: since either time is one of the seven sources of waste， having a waiting room
    packed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with enough patients to keep our dark busy for an entire day seems like a good
    idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We talked about customer waiting times in another module of the scores。 For
    now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let me just point out this is not lean at all。 Remember that inventory is also
    a form of waste and wasting customers are inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I mentioned in the context of my radiology experience at the beginning of
    the module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lean is equally about the customer。 Customers waiting and customers running
    around are also forms of waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so in this session we introduce some tools and measures to capture this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're not changing the perspective from the resource to the perspective of the
    flow unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When owner looked at manufacturing flows， he said he postulated products have
    to flow， like water。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Products have to flow like water。 Well， why wouldn't they？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Water keeps products from smoothly flowing through the production process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take a look at the three-step production process here。 Parts here are taken
    out of inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then they are produced in a casting operation。 Once all the parts are done with
    casting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a transporter moves them over to the machining， operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have to wait it again until the machine is completed。 The previous production
    cycle， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it works and then comes and moves the output over to， the assembly station。
    Of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the other parts are not ready yet in the batch and so they have to wait。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the assembly only starts when all the parts are there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so our part spends even more time waiting。 Finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the parts once they are assembled to get shipped。 Now we can define the flow
    time efficiency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also known as the percentage value at time， as the ratio between the value at
    time and the flow time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the three-step process you'll notice that only a small fraction of the
    flow time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is really adding value。 Most of the flow time， the flow unit sits around waiting
    to move forward in its journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my radiology example， at the beginning of the module， the ratio was 20 minutes
    of care。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: spread out over more than two hours of flow time。 But here's another observation
    about customer experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personally， I would argue that it's not just about the time investment of the
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's also about customer friction， customer effort and pain points。 Personally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd much rather spend 10 hours at home waiting for an email that takes my。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doctor five minutes to write rather than spending one hour in the waiting room
    for a 10 minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discussion。 Now you see that the flow time efficiency is superior in the second
    scenario。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I prefer， the first。 There's this observation behind a tool that is known
    as a service blueprint。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the service blueprint does， it takes all the activities related to one or
    multiple customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: episodes。 And then the service blueprint reorganizes them along two dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From the left to the right we have time。 We start with the early activities
    on the left and work our way to the later activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the right， just like with the previous production timeline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But unlike the production timeline I showed with the casting operation， we now
    also have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a vertical dimension。 The vertical dimension distinguishes where the customer
    service is delivered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On top we have activities that happen at the home of the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Really from a customer perspective， this type of work is preferable。 From my
    customer's perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's generally preferable to deal with work from home compared。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to work that happened on what's called on stage。 On stage stands for work that
    happens at the retail branch in the hospital or inside the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: factory。 But also from the firm's perspective， caring out work on stage tends
    to be expensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You visually incur real estate costs and the firm also has to have the resources
    ready。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exactly when the customer walks in。 So wherever we can， it's nice to move work
    away from the stage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You want to move work off stage。 It's just like checking into your fly from
    home as opposed to doing this at the gate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just think about my radiology example one more time。 Verify my insurance status。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is work that could have been done before I showed up in the hospital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More convenient for me and cheaper for the hospital。 Beyond having the work
    happen at home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can also think about another way of moving it， off stage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine we as a firm could do the work for the customer。 I mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you think about buying stuff on Amazon。 You won't enter any billing or shipping
    information anymore when you buy something on Amazon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know that Amazon has stored everything and remembers it over time so that
    reduces your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work the next time you're going to buy something。 Why can't my hospital do this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why do I have to fill out a four-page survey in the waiting room？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every dime I see my doctor only then to be asked exactly the same questions
    on the survey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when I'm talking to the doctor in the room。 To be fair。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this has gotten a lot better over the last years， but you get my point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So another way of improving the customer experience is through automation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We move effort away from the customer by automating some of the activities。
    In my latest book。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Connected Strategy，" they are wrote with my colleague， Nikolai Sigokow。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We discuss how modern technology can create seamless and magical user experiences
    that。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: do not always require the customer to take action。 Flow units are impatient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so we should get them through our process as fast as we， can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is due for a crankshaft and an autoplant that should not sit in inventory
    for a week。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but rather should be turned over many times during the week or even multiple
    times during。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the day in order to reduce the inventory cost。 But it's also true for a service
    organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where the inventory consists of waiting customers。 And clearly， customers want
    to move as a whole。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so they will be sitting around and waiting。 In either setting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can compute the percentage of flowtime that is used for value-adding activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as a good diagnostic tool to see where flowtime is wasted in the process。 That's
    it for today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I see you soon。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
