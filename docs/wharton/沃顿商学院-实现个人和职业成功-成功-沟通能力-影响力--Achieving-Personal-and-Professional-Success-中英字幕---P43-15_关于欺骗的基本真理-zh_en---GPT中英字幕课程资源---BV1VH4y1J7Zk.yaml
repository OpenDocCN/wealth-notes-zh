- en: I'm going to start with a story about the Kuku Bird。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might be familiar with the Kuku Bird mostly because of the Kuku Clock， but
    it turns out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Kuku Bird can teach us something really important about the deception process。
    The Kuku Bird。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rather than laying its own eggs and feeding its own chicks， actually lays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: eggs in other birds' nests。 So birds like the tree pipette will actually be
    tricked into raising Kuku chicks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's something odd about this。 You can sometimes see Kuku Birds waiting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: watching another bird's nest， waiting for， that bird to leave to go get food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Kuku Bird will fly in， sometimes discard eggs that are already in the nest，
    quickly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lay an egg and then fly away。 Now what happens after that， it's actually even
    more bizarre。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've hijacked a system here， or the Kuku Bird is hijacked a system where as
    soon as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that bird hatches， the Kuku Bird hatches， there's an open beak and here this
    bird mother。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instinctually feeds that open beak， even when the bird looks nothing like their
    own offspring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here you can see a Kuku Bird chick being fed by a tree pipette who's so much
    smaller。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than the chick。 So it can seem really odd and yet we're hijacking this trusting
    process and we've used deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a way that allows Kuku Birds to exploit other birds' generosity。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it turns out deception is hardwired。 I talk about the Kuku Bird because I want
    to suggest the deception of something that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hardwired。 It's not just an aberrant human behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's something that's actually deeply ingrained， in our animal nature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it turns out it's not just Kuku Birds and tree pipettes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kuku Birds do this to many other kinds of birds and there are other birds too
    that engage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the same behavior。 We've seen actually deception documented in ravens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ravens will actually do things that will trick other birds about where food
    is。 We've seen apes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: monkeys， even fish engage in deception。 So catch-up in monkeys， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will sound an alarm as if a predator is nearby to， go steal food from other
    monkeys。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some predators will fake their own death， pretend to be dead until prey comes
    near and they'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grab that prey。 Or in a very prosocial way， you'll see some birds fake injury。
    So the morning dove。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example， if there's a predator nearby and they have young offspring， in
    their nest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will actually pretend to drag their wing as if they're injured to draw attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: away from their offspring。 So they're engaging in deception as soon as the predator
    comes near。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the morning dove， flies off。 So we see deception throughout the wild animal
    kingdom and it's not surprising that it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a really integral part of our human experience。 So here are some key truths
    about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deception hijacks existing systems。 So like the tree pipit， there's a system
    that's hardwired。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tree pipit will feed the beak of a hungry bird in its nest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a reasonable system and the kookabur is just figured out how to exploit
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the same is true in a lot of our other transactions where， for example，
    a lot of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: scammers with telephone calls will hijack existing trusting systems or somebody
    will， say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"I''m in trouble。 I need help。"， We''re hijacking that system and deception
    exploits trust。 Now。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deception is also hardwired。 It's something that we're hardwired to do and it's
    actually an important part of our cognitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: development as we develop more complicated thinking， deception comes along with
    that。 Third。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deception is often successful。 Most deception goes undetected and that makes
    it a very pervasive issue that's sometimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a big problem and sometimes a benefit。 And so this fourth point about deception
    is it's not always bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in fact， I'm going to argue that we should teach people how and when to
    deceive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's a developmental milestone。 So when your child starts telling you lies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rather than punishing them too severely， I would actually celebrate that milestone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It demonstrates a theory of mind。 The idea that what's in our own heads is different
    than what's in everybody else's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: head。 And deception reflects that。 That is， it's the recognition that what I
    know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know I just had a cookie， but you， might not know that。 And so when I tell
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"I haven''t had a cookie yet，" it''s a demonstration of this theory， of mind。
    Of course。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm trying to get another cookie， but it represents the idea that I know that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might not know that。 And that really represents an important ability for
    us to take perspective and to engage with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other people successfully。 And of course， there are many positive ways for us
    to use that deception to say things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like， "I really like that gift or I'm really happy you showed up。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So deception is a developmental milestone and not just something to be punished。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And deception is chronic。 In surveys of teenagers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they found that 86% say they lie to their parents on a regular， basis。 75% say
    they lie to friends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 73% say they lie to siblings。 So it's not just parents， but teenagers say they
    lie all the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Couples， in couples， 69%， more than two-thirds say they lie to their spouse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the lies we tell tend to be a little bit different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So women are more likely to lie in a prosocial way to make people feel better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And men are more likely to lie in ways that enhance themselves， that make them
    look better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than they actually are。 So there's some slight differences in how we lie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the persistence of lying is really。
