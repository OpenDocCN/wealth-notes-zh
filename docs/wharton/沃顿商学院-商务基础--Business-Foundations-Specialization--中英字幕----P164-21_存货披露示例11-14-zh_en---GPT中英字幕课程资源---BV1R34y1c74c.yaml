- en: Hello and Professor Brian Boucher and welcome back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this video we're going to take a look at a disclosure of a company that uses
    LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things that you may have to do at some point is compare a firm that
    uses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LIFO to a firm that uses FIFO。 If you do that you need to convert the LIFO firm
    to a FIFO basis to make any kind of reasonable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comparison between the two because the ending inventory and the cogs are so
    different between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the two methods that you really can't compare them without adjusting the LIFO
    firm to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO basis。 So let's see how that happens。 Let's get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To facilitate the comparison of LIFO and FIFO firms， LIFO firms have to disclose
    what their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory costs would be under FIFO。 Another way we can convert all of the results
    for the LIFO firm to a FIFO basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's the only direction we can go。 There's no way that we can convert
    a FIFO firm to LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about it it would be a pretty daunting task because a company that's
    always。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: done first and first out would have to go back and look at its entire history
    of inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: purchases to redo it under last in first out。 But if you're doing it last in
    first out it's fairly easy to transfer those results to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first in first out。 So what we're going to get into this disclosure is something
    called the LIFO reserve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The LIFO reserve is the difference between what the ending inventory would be
    under FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first in first out and what the inventory is under LIFO which is what they disclose
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the balance sheet。 To adjust the income statement we can use the fact that the
    change in the LIFO reserve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is equal to LIFO COGS minus FIFO COGS。 So what we're trying to figure out for
    the LIFO firm is what its COGS would be under。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO。 So that means that FIFO COGS would equal LIFO COGS which is what was disclosed
    in the income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: statement minus this change in LIFO reserve。 And then translating that to net
    income the FIFO net income is going to be LIFO net income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: plus the change in LIFO reserve times one minus the tax rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to multiply the change in LIFO reserve times one minus the tax rate
    to get an after。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tax version because with net income we're looking at an after tax number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And notice that when we're dealing with COGS we subtract the LIFO reserve but
    with net。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: income we add it because COGS is an expense whereas net income is revenue minus
    expenses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the last things I have up here are tax savings during the current year are
    the change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the LIFO reserve times the tax rate and the tax savings cumatively over the
    whole。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LIFO firm would be whatever the balance in the LIFO reserve is times the tax
    rate。

- en: Sorry， I zoned out for a second。 What is that triangle thing and when would
    we ever have to do this again？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah， I think I zoned out myself while reading the words on that slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Page of formulas is not fun and I think if I had spent even more time trying
    to explain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the intuition it would have made it even less fun。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So to answer your question the triangle is the Greek letter delta which means
    change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will have to use formulas like this if you're ever looking at a LIFO company
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to compare it to a company that uses FIFO。 Basically the inventory method
    has such a distorting effect on ending inventory and cost of goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sold that the only way you could get a reasonable comparison of those firms
    would be to convert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the LIFO firm to FIFO which we're going to do right now in an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a look at an example of a LIFO disclosure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to look at KP incorporated which manufactures flux capacitors
    and if you don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know what those are you can just pause right now and search on Wikipedia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: KP uses the LIFO method so if we want to compare KP's results to compare their
    financial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: statements to firms that use the FIFO method we have to switch KP from LIFO
    to FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cost of goods sold for KP were 18-55 during 2012。 Companies tax rate is 35%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Questions that we're going to try to answer from the disclosure are what is
    the FIFO value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the inventory that allows to compare balance sheet of KP to a balance sheet
    of a company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that uses FIFO。 What would be the FIFO COGS in 2012？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we want to compare the income statement between KP and a FIFO firm putting
    KP on a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO basis will facilitate the comparison and then we're going to see how much
    in taxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f80c7a43145ac64acb8c6ffb30fe665f_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: KP saved during the year。 So here is the disclosure in the footnotes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The thing I want to point out before we get into the LIFO stuff is this is what
    the disclosure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looks like for the breakdown of raw materials， work and process and finish goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you remember a couple of videos ago we talked about how manufacturing
    firms have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these three buckets of inventory。 Looks like in KP situation their raw materials
    and work and process are both up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their finished goods are down slightly which probably means they're ramping
    up production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work and processes up。 They ordered more raw materials so maybe they're anticipating
    even more sales or more production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and their finished goods are down which probably means they're having no trouble
    selling their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory。 So those all indicate that the company is growing well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's take a look at the LIFO disclosure。 So we want to figure out what
    the LIFO value of the inventory is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The formula is that the FIFO inventory is going to be the LIFO inventory plus
    the LIFO， reserve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we see the LIFO value of the inventory at the bottom line 518 and 540。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Less revaluation to LIFO that's the terminology for LIFO reserve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in 2012 we take 518 plus 102 to get to 620 and for 2011 we take 540 plus
    63 to get， to 603。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the LIFO reserve is in brackets and that is representing that it's a credit
    balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're not going to get into the journal entries so don't worry about it
    but it's negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it's reducing 620 minus the LIFO reserve to 518。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when we look at these equations we just treat the LIFO reserve as a positive
    number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we take 518 plus 102 to get to 620 and as you notice the 620 and the 603
    the 518。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO value of the inventory is actually disclosed by KP even though they don't
    label it as the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO value。 Now let's look at what FIFO COGS would have been in 2012。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here the formula is FIFO COGS is LIFO COGS minus the change in the LIFO reserve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So FIFO COGS is 1855 which is what we saw before it was something that was given
    with， the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could also find this from the income statement。 The change in the LIFO reserve
    is 102 minus 63。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again we're ignoring the brackets we're just taking 102 minus 63 and we subtract
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from 1855 to get FIFO COGS of 1816。 So the FIFO COGS are 39 less than the LIFO
    COGS。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shall I infer from this example that COGS and the LIFO is always greater than
    COGS and， to FIFO？ No。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: please don't infer that from this example。 The only reason that LIFO COGS are
    greater than FIFO COGS is that prices have been rising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If prices of inventory have been dropping then LIFO COGS would be less than
    FIFO COGS。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So think of it this way， LIFO is last in first out so LIFO is very sensitive
    to the direction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of price movement。 If prices are going up LIFO COGS will be higher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if prices are going down LIFO COGS will be， lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the last question we want to answer is how much did KP save in taxes in
    2012 by using， LIFO？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the formula before is that the tax savings are equal to the change in LIFO
    reserve times， 35%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Change in LIFO reserve is again 102 minus 63。 That's the 39 that was the difference
    in COGS that we saw before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So LIFO gave you higher COGS by 39。 If we take 35% of that that's the tax savings
    based on that higher expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those tax savings come out to be 13。65。 Now it doesn't indicate here but
    these numbers are in millions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's a tax savings of $13，650，000 for KP。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f80c7a43145ac64acb8c6ffb30fe665f_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Those are some nice tax savings。 Why does the US government allow companies
    to use LIFO？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is like letting them cheat on taxes。 Yes， those are some really nice tax
    savings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why does the US government allow it？ Well it's probably because the companies
    that get those tax savings take some of those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tax savings and donate them to senators and congressmen that in turn vote to
    keep LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the books。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f80c7a43145ac64acb8c6ffb30fe665f_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Sorry that was probably a bit too conspiratorial so just ignore that prior comment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there is right now an active discussion about whether companies should get
    this tax， break。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact in the most recent budget proposed by the administration in the US there
    is a proposal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to eliminate LIFO as a way to raise additional taxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there is heavy lobbying against that and the government here has seemed
    unable to pass。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a budget for years。 We are sort of living off these continuing resolutions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it is at least up for debate and it may be that at some point the US government
    also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gets rid of LIFO as a way to close this loophole and sort of take away this
    advantage of companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to earn significant tax savings。 So now that I have just mentioned that the
    US government may get rid of LIFO as well I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should probably cut my losses and stop talking about it given that it may go
    away within。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the next year or so。 But anyway that wraps up our look at inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All we have left for the week is our look at the 3M Company， 3M Company Finance
    statements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you then。
