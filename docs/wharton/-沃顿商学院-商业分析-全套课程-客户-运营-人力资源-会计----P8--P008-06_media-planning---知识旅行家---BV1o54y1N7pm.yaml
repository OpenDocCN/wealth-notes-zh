- en: so now from point of sales data，let's go to media planning，now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: i want to give you some examples of how companies can go ahead and collect some
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes themselves and sometimes by the aid of other companies to get a sense
    of audience engagement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so in radio，for example，there are companies out there that can collect this
    type of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so kantar media，for instance collects a lot of data in terms of who is listening
    to different radio shows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how is the popularity of different stations，and so on there are other companies
    as well that collect this type of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example nian audio again，you can think about these kinds of engagement，even
    at the tv level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so here nielsen collects a lot of data，which is from the tv level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how do they do that with a set top box，so this is the box which will go along
    with your cable box。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are they trying to do here，they're trying to basically record。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who are the people who are watching a particular tv station，who is it in the
    family。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then they aggregate at different households，to get a sense of how popular
    is a particular tv show。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how popular are different channels and so on，so again ac nielsen is not the
    only company doing this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are many other companies as well，another company is the following example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: again rent track is a company that basically collects information again about
    tv engagement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's slightly different ways of doing it，but the overall idea is exactly
    the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what would we want to do in these kinds of issues，tv or radio get a sense of
    how popular is a particular show or a particular channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the kinds of questions that can be answered，with these kinds of data
    that's available。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so for example，who is watching what show as a brand manager，or in fact as a
    tv station manager。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we would like to know which shows are popular，which shows potentially can be
    funded next year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how is the viewership pattern changing over time，and for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you start thinking about viewership pattern，how should i be spending different
    kinds of money on different types of ads。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in these tv shows，so broadly these kinds of questions can be answered by getting
    information about audience engagement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's what companies like nielsen，companies like kantar media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's what they're doing when they're collecting different types of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: either through radio shows or for tv shows，so now we'll talk about social media
    analytics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so social media is becoming extremely popular，there are many many people on
    facebook twitter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you name the different formats，people are there talking about brands，talking
    to each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on so clearly when you think about it yourself，as a brand manager。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you start thinking about what are customers talking about，you need data about
    social media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and there are companies out there that will help you get that data，for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hootsuite is a company that does a lot of information and data collection on
    things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going on on facebook or twitter，so it's a platform that collects that data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sprout social is another example，so there are many companies out there that
    are collecting information on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what customers are saying and doing on social media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so what are the kinds of questions that a manager can answer using this type
    of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the first one is just audience engagement，if i'm running a campaign on facebook。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if i'm running a campaign on twitter，how many people are responding，that gives
    me a sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on how good that campaign is，another example might be more along the lines of
    thinking about brand mentions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is our brand being mentioned more times than our competitors，what's our share
    of voice，so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example，as we just saw we could track，for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how many times wharton came up in the last month on twitter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can start doing this search for your own brand，and see how it compares to
    your competitors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can also start thinking about doing sentiment analysis，so it's not just
    about mentions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but how is it being mentioned，is it being mentioned in a positive way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is it being mentioned in a negative way，how is it being mentioned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4e9345e00553499d47ef1de6ee74fd36_2.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and then you can start thinking about linking，for instance，what might be going
    on in the economy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all different kinds of issues，together with brand mentions to see how they might
    change over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so social media data is very，very powerful，there are companies out there that
    can help you collect this type of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to see how your company is trending on social media as compared to your competitors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so now we'll talk about another type of data，this is broadly categorized as
    web data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this would be basically，all the different kinds of searches that you're doing
    on the internet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the different websites that people might be visiting and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of course there's a wealth of information out there，first is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can start looking at your own company's website and seeing what customers
    are looking at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but at the same time，you also want to know what's happening in the marketplace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's where these other companies come in，for example，compete dot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: com is a website that will allow you to look at what people are looking at，at
    different sites。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are，of course many other companies that do the same thing，for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comscore is another company that collects this type of data as well，so are many
    other companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so this is another example，and lots of other companies that basically collect
    information on what are people searching for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which websites are visiting，and so on what does a data stream look like again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4e9345e00553499d47ef1de6ee74fd36_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: i went to compete，com，and looked for the type of searches。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the type of people who are coming in on the wharton website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's what it looks like in the last month，so it gives you information on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for instance on unique visitors and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4e9345e00553499d47ef1de6ee74fd36_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: so besides，of course，going out and looking at companies that collect a wealth
    of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can have data from your own website，for instance，as an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: etsy com is a company where you can get a lot of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for instance on what are people looking at，so etsy has this data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can look at what people are searching for，and get a sense of what products
    are becoming popular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what websites for example are becoming popular，and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4e9345e00553499d47ef1de6ee74fd36_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: so collectively web data，gives you a lot of information in terms of what your
    customers are looking at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: either on your own website or competitive website，and so on，broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this type of data helps you answer questions which are very managerally oriented。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can start thinking about any kind of campaign，you can broadly categorize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the type of spending that you're doing in terms of earned media，aid media and
    own media，own media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: basically is your own website，aid media，is any kind of engagement that you're
    doing in terms of paying for that media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and earned media，are people who are organically coming to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you start thinking about collecting this type of web data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it gives you a sense of what is the roi for many kinds of campaigns，that you're
    doing so again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the type of data and the type of questions you're trying to answer，have to go
    hand in hand，finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of course，when you start thinking about the holy grail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's mobile data that's where many many companies are making inroads，think about
    facebook。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of course it started off as a desktop，but many more people are accessing facebook
    using their mobile phones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: facebook has this data，they know where people are accessing facebook。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they know the location as well，that's a wealth of information，as another
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is foursquare again，this is a website in which people kind of check in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: usually through their mobile phone，foursquare again has a lot of information
    on where people are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where they are checking in what else is around them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so many many such companies are basically collecting this information on the
    flip side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are companies such as fluy analytics，what do they do，they get a sense
    of，you know，hey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how's your app doing in terms of overall customer engagement，and they can also
    start helping you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: monetize the app，and make it better in terms of people accessing it easily。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and trying to make more money out of that，what are the type of managerial questions
    that can be answered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example，is customers search in the mobile platform，different from the desktop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what information should show customers based on their location，so think about
    foursquare。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for instance，they have information on where you are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should the information they show you be different，depending on your location，probably
    yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and of course another type of question would be，are there coupons that can be
    sent based on your location。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4e9345e00553499d47ef1de6ee74fd36_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: all of these questions can be answered by looking at mobile data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and again there are companies out there that can help you collect the data，you
    collect the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you collect the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
