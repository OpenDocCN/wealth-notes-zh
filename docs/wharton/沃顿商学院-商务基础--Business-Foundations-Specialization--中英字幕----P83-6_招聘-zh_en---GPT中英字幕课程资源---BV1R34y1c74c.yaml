- en: So let's talk about another issue in managing people and one that gets a lot
    of attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/04986adb171c1cbaaa5f05919db06e1b_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: these days。 That's the question of hiring。 One of the reasons it gets so much
    attention is just a lot more hiring going on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: partly， because there's less internal development， promotion from within， and
    much more filling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: positions from the outside。 So if you thought that management was really everything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then it wouldn't matter who you， hired， it's all about how you manage them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't think that's true， but we also don't think it's true， a theory that
    became popular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a decade or two ago， that it's really about the quality of the players coming
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll talk more about this a little later， the idea that they're A players and
    really， good players。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: B players average performers and C players， lousy ones。 And it's all about hiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's not true either。 So hiring matters is not the only thing that matters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Management matters a lot as well。 There are two steps in hiring and the first
    one is recruiting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the people you get to apply to work for you。 And the second is selection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you look at the applicant pool， who you're going to pick， we spend way
    too much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time focused on selection， I think。 That gets all the attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the problem with selection is it's， first of all， if you've got the wrong
    applicant pool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can't hire the right people if they're not in your pool to begin with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And selection is just really hard to do。 And the reason it's hard to do is because
    candidates lie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't tell you the truth。 And they want a job。 They want you to hire them
    at that point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've applied to work for you。 And if you ask them things like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: does this company look like the kind of place you want， to be， they say， oh，
    yeah。 If you ask them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's your biggest problem or biggest drawback to working with you， they， say
    things like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I work too hard， right？ They're trying to spin you a story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's very difficult to get past that at the point of selection。 Let's talk
    about recruitment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think all employers ought to spend more time crafting an accurate description
    of what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/04986adb171c1cbaaa5f05919db06e1b_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: their job is like。 One of the biggest reasons people quit is they say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I didn't know what I was getting into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/04986adb171c1cbaaa5f05919db06e1b_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This is not what I wanted。 That's completely preventable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think frankly the reason it happens is employers are kind of afraid to
    show people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what their job is really like。 They want them to only see the good things when
    they're applying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then the problem is they got to live together afterwards and they discover
    the reality and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: poof they quit。 This is kind of like if you're going to live together with somebody
    or get married and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're hiding a whole bunch of stuff and you're hoping after you're married
    that they'll all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be okay with it。 It typically doesn't work very well。 It doesn't work very well
    in hiring either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what you want is a description of what your job is like that is accurate
    and also one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that will probably scare away people who don't fit。 Because you don't want those
    people applying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every person applies costs you money and every chance that somebody gets in
    it really， doesn't fit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every time that happens it increases the probability you're going to make a
    bad hire。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you want a statement some people call this the employee value proposition
    about what's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different working for us than other companies maybe that are in the same industry
    plus side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and minus side what's different about working for us。 And you want that to be
    accurate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now one way to do this is with internships。 You might think that the typical
    reason for internships is the candidate can scope you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out and decide or you can scope the candidate out rather and decide whether
    this is the kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of person you want。 But a lot of companies have figured out that the more important
    use of that is the candidate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can scope you out。 So that if you offer them a job and they say yes they know
    what they're getting into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's kind of a retention device to make sure you're not going to lose people
    as soon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as you hire them。 So remember you know not hiring somebody is a problem if you
    can't hire that certainly a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: problem but hiring somebody who ends up quitting is arguably a worse problem
    because you've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gone through all the costs of bringing them in and if they're unhappy and quit
    they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making the people around them unhappy and then you got to repeat the process
    anyway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we take that more seriously we spend more time on recruitment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now on selection what do we know is a huge literature on this but let me summarize
    it， briefly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The things that matter the most are things associated with past behavior tends
    to be the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: best predictor of future behavior。 If you could actually find out how they performed
    in a similar job before that would be great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That would be maybe the best thing you could get。 It's hard to get that in many
    countries hard to get good references from people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you could get that though that would be wonderful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's partly why internal moves of people who already work for you are so good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much better than hiring from the outside typically because you know a lot about
    that person already。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and information is pretty accurate。 So that's really good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other things that are really good skill tests work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it's important to know whether this person has the skills to program。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Give them a programming problem and see if they can solve it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is you can only do skills tests generally for more of the simpler
    basic sorts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of skills。 Conscientiousness out of personality matters that's the only thing
    that consistently matters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out of personality。 IQ seems to matter a bit but when we talk about these things
    mattering it's important to recognize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much are we talking about and it turns out not very much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for some of these things you might see a correlation between let's say personality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: test conscientiousness and job performance of 0。3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might say oh that looks pretty good right but we need to remember from statistics
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the amount of variation that explains is the square R squared right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Correlation is R the amount of variation explained is R squared。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that personality test only explains 9% of the variation in performance 0。3
    times 0。3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's only the case if you don't have other things in there already that
    might be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: correlated or similar to personality。 If you've got past job performance in
    there the amount that you add by throwing in personality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or IQ or something else is even smaller than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the punchline there is we're not that great at being able to predict on average
    how well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: any particular candidate is going to do which is why recruitment is so important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the last issue about hiring is the idea about how it drives organizational
    culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a theory people call attraction selection attrition and the reason they
    call it that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is here's how it works。 If you've got a company with a particular culture candidates
    come they see the culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or they know about what the company is like people start to self select that's
    what you， want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the people who end up applying are already pretty similar to your standard
    and then your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company or your organization picks from that applicant pool people it likes
    things are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to succeed they tend to pick people who are like themselves it's not crazy
    those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people have succeeded。 And then the people who are the most different feel they
    don't fit are the ones that leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you end up with at the end of the day a group of people who are very
    similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of norms and values maybe that's fine。 It also reminds us why we don't
    get diversity in organizations though because this process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which happens more or less everywhere tends to replicate the type of organization
    you've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: already got。 So one of the lessons from this is if you want diversity you got
    to build it in as a priority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because the natural process like this which plays out at all hiring tends to
    work against， that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay。 Now unfortunately the reality of hiring doesn't look much like textbook
    descriptions there's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of textbooks that describe complicated models of hiring that begins with
    filling out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: descriptions of jobs and then how they fit into organizational hierarchies and
    the competencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and all this kind of stuff。 Fencing applications or posting positions posting
    applications all that stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reality of technology is changing this a lot。 So this last year in the United
    States for example a Federal Reserve calculated the majority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of people who move jobs we're not looking for a job at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Somebody came and got them and this is because of technology like LinkedIn and
    other sources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where you can look at people where they work their record and go ping them and
    say I think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you would be a good fit for us。 The applicant process is now driven by computers
    technology called applicant tracking systems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where computers screen resumes so to get through that process your resume has
    to have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the right words on it which is another complication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also possible that you can outsource the whole hiring process firms called
    in an industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: called recruitment process outsourcing we'll just do the whole thing for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course it's also possible to not hire anybody at all but to engage labor
    through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: staffing agencies you lease the employees of a staffing company you're not hiring
    them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're not really managing them directly。 There's all kinds of ways in which
    you can get labor now that doesn't involve hiring anybody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at all。 So there's a lot of choices now about how you might manage things and
    it increases the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: complexity of all this requires a deeper dive into all these things and unfortunately
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: standard sources and the textbooks are not really up to speed as to the reality
    of how。
