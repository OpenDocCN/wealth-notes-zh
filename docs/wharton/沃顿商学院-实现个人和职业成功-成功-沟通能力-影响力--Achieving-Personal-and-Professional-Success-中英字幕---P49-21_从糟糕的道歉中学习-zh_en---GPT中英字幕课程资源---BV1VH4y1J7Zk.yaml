  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the shortcomings with this apology is that it ends up falling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to see if this thing would blow over。"， Now meanwhile as he's dithering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    apology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all， who goes， it's the head of the US division， not the head of the
    company。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e173449464d4196362641f1f44e9e174_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This apology falls short in a couple of ways。 One is it's defecting blame。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This wasn't a corporate decision。 The cars are safe to drive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't really know exactly what's going to happen。 The recall and process
    could take years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing that happens is first of all he's saying look I'm not really
    in charge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so it comes across as a limited apology。 It's not the head of VW that's
    going there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the second part is there's no commitment to change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we really want to do is understand what VW is going to do and we want that
    clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: credible commitment to change and in this case it would almost certainly involve
    bringing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an outside party for oversight。 So here are some of the lessons we can draw
    from failed apologies。
