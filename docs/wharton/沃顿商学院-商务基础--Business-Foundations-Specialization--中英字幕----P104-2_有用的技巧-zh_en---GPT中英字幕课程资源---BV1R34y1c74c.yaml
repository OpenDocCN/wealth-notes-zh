  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of cash flows that we see often in practice。 Let's get started。 Hey everybody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: welcome to our third lecture on the time value of money。 So last time we talked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about compounding or the process of moving cash flows forward in time， excuse
    me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to find their future value whereas in our first lecture we moved cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back in time via discounting to find their present value。 So what I want to
    do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: today is I want to give you some useful shortcuts for computing the present
    value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or the future value of some streams of cash flows that commonly arise in， practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's get started。 The first thing I want to talk about is an， annuity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An annuity is a finite stream of cash flows of identical magnitude。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and equal spacing in time and I've highlighted key elements of this， definition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's a timeline representing an annuity。 First key。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: aspect or feature of an annuity is or are cash flows of identical magnitude。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are all of these cash flows are the same number。 So identical， magnitude。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly this is a finite stream of cash flows。 It ends at some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: point in time and that might seem like an unnecessary or obvious assumption
    but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll see that we'll deal with infinite cash flow streams in a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the last assumption is that the spacing between the cash flows has
    to be， equal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's always a year。 We always get the cash flow after one year， two， months。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whatever that spacing it is it has to be the same。 And it turns out that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this cash flow stream arises in a number of situations in practice。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: insurance companies sell a product called an annuity representing its， cash
    flow stream。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Home mortgages are an example of an annuity stream。 Auto leases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: certain bond payments and amortizing loans are annuities。 So it's actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fairly common in practice。 Now if we wanted to find the present value of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these cash flows we could we know how to do that。 Right we can brute force it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can take each cash flow and discount it back to today。 Right so imagine I
    had a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: second cash flow。 I had the second cash flow here。 I could take go CF divided
    by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1 plus R squared that would bring it back to today。 I could take this cash flow
    CF。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over 1 plus R to the T minus 1 that would bring it and I do that for all the
    cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flows and then I could add them up here。 That would give me the present value。
    But。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's a bit burdensome especially when T is big。 So what I'd like to show you
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a shortcut or a simple formula to compute the present value of this cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stream and here it is。 We take the cash flow CF。 We take divided by the discount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rate and multiply it by this term in parentheses here。 Now if I move the R。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over here I can re-express the present value of the annuity formula as just
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: annuity cash flow times this term here which is called an annuity factor。 That。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will give me the present value of this cash flow stream。 One thing to keep in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mind though is that in order for this formula to make sense not only do all
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: features defining an annuity stream have to be true but we're assuming that
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first cash flow arrives one period from today。 So for example if my cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stream look like this this is an annuity stream of cash flows but this formula
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not going to give me the present value of this cash flow stream。 Actually what
    I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would have to do is I could just add CF because this is the present value。 It's，
    coming today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's do an example。 How much do I have to save today to withdraw。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: $100 at the end of each of the next 20 years if I can earn 5% per annum？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: step one is draw a timeline。 I'm trying to figure out how much I have to save。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: today in order to pull out $100 every year over the next 20 years。 Well we know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how to do that by brute force。 We can simply discount all of the cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back into today's time units and add them up。 More elegant solution that we
    just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learned of course is to apply our present value of annuity formula。 Right the
    cash， flow is 100 CF。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The discount rate R is 5% and the time of the cash flows is 20， years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Plugging all those numbers into the formula and computing we get the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: present value of these cash flows is $1，246。22。 That's how much money I have
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: save today in order to withdraw the $100 every year。 Now let's turn to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something called a growing annuity which is as the name suggests just like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an annum and witty but for the fact that the cash flows are growing。 So it's
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finite stream of cash flows。 Okay evenly spaced through time。 Okay but now the
    cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flows aren't constant they're growing at a constant rate G。 And this this type
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cash flow stream pops up in a number of instances in practice。 Certain income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: streams for example your work right you might imagine that your work your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: salary grows at some constant rate G or approximately some constant rate G。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certain saving strategies maybe you want to save a certain amount each year
    but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want that amount to grow with your growing income stream。 In corporate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finance certain project revenue and expense streams will often grow at a， near
    constant growth rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's a really useful approximation to many cash， flow streams will come across
    in practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And like our annuity stream we can， represent the present value of this cash
    flow stream with a simple formula as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: follows we take the cash flow as of the first period divided by the discount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rate less the growth rate times this factor here。 That will give us the present。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: value of this cash flow stream right here。 Okay。 But remember a critical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assumption is that the first cash flow arrives one period from today。 Okay。
    Let's， do an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much do we have to save today to withdraw $100 at the end of， this year？
    $102。50 next year $105。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 06 the year after and so on for the next 19， years if we can earn 5% per annum。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well let's draw a timeline and what we see， is that our first first withdrawal
    of $100 occurs one year out then 102。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5 and， on and on and on。 What we can discern from this problem is that these
    cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flows are growing at a constant rate G equal to 2。5% per annum。 So this cash
    flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stream satisfies all of the requirements needed to use the present value of
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: growing annuity formula。 So our first cash flow of $100 our discount rate of
    5%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and here's our growth rate of 2。5%。 That's going to get us a present value of，
    $1，529。69。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's how much we would need to withdraw $100 growing at 2。5%， every year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's talk about a perpetuity。 So perpetuity is just like an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: annuity except the cash flows go on forever。 We get the same amount of money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: equally spaced in time forever。 So where does this thing come up in practice？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well oddly enough it actually does and something called perpetuities or console。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bonds which exist over in the UK and interestingly enough the formula for this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cash flow stream is very simple。 It's just the cash flow divided by the discount，
    rate CF over R。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's do an example。 How much do you have to save today to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: withdraw $100 at the end of each year forever if you can earn 5% per annum？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well the timeline looks as follows。 $100 every year forever and clearly the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: brute force method of discounting each cash flow one at a time is never going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to work it's just impossible。 So we have to use our formula。 We take the $100。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divided by the discount rate of 5% and that gives us $2，000。 We need $2，000
    to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: able to withdraw $100 a year forever assuming that money can earn 5% per annum。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And intuitively what's going on is once we get out 100 years 200 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whatever the present value of that money is so small it's very close to zero
    which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is why you don't need an infinite amount of money。 And the perpetuity's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cousin a growing perpetuity is just that it's an infinite stream of cash flow
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grows at a constant rate G and that are evenly spaced out through time。 So here's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a visual representation here's our timeline of a growing perpetuity。 What's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an example of a growing perpetuity in practice？ Well dividend streams are much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like a growing perpetuity。 They're a useful approximation don't take it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: literally companies don't last forever but we can treat them as such because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is no finite end date to most companies。 Apps in some events such as a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bankruptcy or an acquisition or a take over something like that。 So what's the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: formula for a growing perpetuity？ Well it's just the cash flow that we're going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to receive in the first year divided by the discount rate minus the growth rate，
    of that cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again we're going to have to assume that the first cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: arrives one year from today to use this formula as well as having all the other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: requirements being satisfied。 The cash flow is being evenly spaced and then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: growing at a constant rate。 So let's do a little example now。 How much do you，
    have to save？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much do you have to save today to withdraw $100 at the end of， this year？
    102。5 next year， 105。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 06 the year after and so on forever if we can earn， 5% per ann。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well let's draw our timeline so we're going to get $100 here in year， one。 102。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5 in year two that's growing at 2。5% as is the 105。06 if I had written it， here。
    So our G is 2。5%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first cash flow comes one year from today。 There's， our first cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This goes on forever and the spacing is equal so this is a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: growing perpetuity to which we can apply our growing perpetuity present value，
    formula。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we take the first cash flow $100 divided by the difference between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the discount rate and the growth rate to get $4，000。 In other words if we have，
    $4。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 today and it's earning 5% interest per annum every year thereafter we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pull out $100 next year and have that amount grow by 2。5% every year thereafter。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's summarize。 We learned a couple of useful shortcuts today。 We talked
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an annuity and its present value formula。 We talked about a perpetuity and its。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: present value formula。 We talked about their growing cousins the growing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: annuity and the growing perpetuity and the present value formula for those guys。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And while that might seem somewhat esoteric and bland or boring we also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discussed some of the applications that you might see in practice these cash
    flow， streams arising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And where these shortcuts are really useful more than just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finding the present value or the future value is in finding the cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: associated with the stream。 So being able to manipulate these formulas is very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: important and so in the problems you're going to spend some time in real life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: contacts or at least as close to real life as we can get manipulating these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: formulas to derive certain aspects of interest whether it's the cash flow or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: problem set it really brings the material to life but be very careful that applying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these formulas takes care。 Don't blindly apply them to any setting because as
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discussed certain characteristics of the cash flows have to be met in order
    to or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    luck。
