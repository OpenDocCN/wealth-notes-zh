 Hi， welcome to the success course。

![](img/ae113cf0621a4290405f13296333fd6d_1.png)

 My name is Richard Shell。 I'm a senior professor here at the Wharton School。

 I've been here for decades。 I've taught many courses。

 I'm probably best known for teaching courses on negotiation and persuasion。

 I also teach a course on responsibility。 But the course we're going to work on together。

 the course we're going to do together， is， a course that I teach and have taught for 10 years called the literature of success。

 It's really a course on what success means for each individual student who takes it。

 And we're creating this online experience for you to give you a chance to join us in。

 a Wharton setting。 I'm going to be treating this as if you were coming to my office hours。

 We're going to be talking about all the different elements of success and how we explore that。

 You'll be getting assessments。 You'll be getting some sort of self-analysis tools that will help you understand a little。

 bit more about what this big word success means to you。

 And as we work together throughout this course， I think you're going to find that I'm going。

 to be asking you to challenge yourself， to think about the values that you really hold。

 to think about the family of influences that have affected who you are and why you are。

 what you are。 And hopefully begin to gather some ideas about what your genuine heartfelt meaning is for。

 this word success and then how individually you can go about achieving it in the best way。

 for yourself。 We're going to do it through a series of classes on different topics。

 You'll be doing some work on values。 You'll be doing some work on your capabilities and your unique talents。

 We'll be looking deeply at how people achieve things， what achievement actually means。

 We'll be looking at some depth at a word that the culture that we live in thinks a great。

 deal of but doesn't really know much about and that word is happiness。

 And then I'm going to be doing what I can to help you to contextualize what we've talked。

 about in a way that you can use， take action on， begin to formulate specific goals on by。

 the end of the class so that you're beginning to have some clear ideas about who you are。

 what you do well and the direction that you want to take at this stage of your life。

 So I look forward to working with you。 We're sitting， as I said。

 in my office right here and this is going to be the place where， we handle the whole course。

 So good luck。 Grab your seatbelt in。 I think you're going to find it a lot of fun and somewhat challenging。

 So I look forward to it。 Thank you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
