- en: A final analysis that we'd like to do with these data is what's called a cluster
    analysis。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It allows us to see whether there are groups of students that exhibit similar
    patterns of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influence。 And I held off on doing this for years because we didn't have the
    power and it's kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an alluring analysis to do but it can be deceptive if you don't have a big sample。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But at this point we have over a thousand and it's time to start looking at
    this kind， of thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what we find is that there are clusters distinct clusters in our data and
    I think， it's useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it gives you a way of thinking， kind of a scaffolding for thinking about where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you fit and therefore what you might want to work on。 So broadly we see five
    clusters here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll describe each one in a little more detail but we see the buddy cluster
    which is about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a third of our population。 We see another third which we call the analyst culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have about a half of a third， a sixth in the nascent culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: About 10% in the multi and a little bit less than 10% about 8% in what we call
    a hammer， cluster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's dive into each of these to help you better understand the clusters
    that are out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there and where you might fit among these clusters。 So first is the nascent
    cluster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The visualization here is kind of a beta visualization we're working with where
    we take each of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 12 tactics on the radial here and then the smaller the pie associated with that
    tactic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the lower the percentile on that particular tactic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we've also color coded the pie slices according to the factor whether it's
    hard power， smart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: power or soft power。 So in these graphs the two slices might an ethos count
    as hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've just kind of simplified the factor analysis into these two are hard power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The four green ones are smart power and the six blue ones are soft power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in the nascent cluster this is just a representative participant with the
    relatively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: low score on all three factors。 Nacens just aren't really using much of the
    toolbox。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're not getting much leverage because they're not doing these behaviors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again this is something like 16% of our sample。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The analyst cluster which is a much bigger chunk of our sample something like
    31%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are folks who are using smart power extensively。 They're high on smart
    power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're low on soft power and they're kind of in the middle on hard power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a cluster that is one of the stereotypes of NBA's。 These are folks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know the caricature of someone who wants to stay with their computer， stay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work on the spreadsheet， not really interested or even thinking about these
    other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tactics especially the relationship tactics of soft power tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The buddy cluster is another one of the NBA's stereotypes。 Again about a third
    of our sample。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This one shows a person who is very high on all the soft power tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're doing all the relationship behaviors at a high frequency but they're
    almost doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: no smart power whatsoever。 They're below average on that and again kind of middling
    or ambiguous on the hard power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: side。 So this is a cluster I did I would have known existed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I kind of discovered it over the years when I would do the debrief with students
    and I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would ever now then stumble across a group of them who were really high on these
    soft。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: power tactics but they really weren't paying attention or even aware of the
    smart power， ones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hammers are happily a smaller percentage of our students but kind of the most
    stereotypical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in that these are hard power people。 Above average use of might and ethos and
    then not doing a lot on the soft power and smart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: power。 Finally we have these multi's。 Multi's are about 10% of our sample。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are folks who are above average on all three。 They're making good use
    of the toolbox。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are little budding Abraham Lincoln's who are able to play on all 12 influence
    tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might ask whether it matters and because we have those performance measures
    the reports。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of how much impact participants are having in their organizations we can see
    if it matters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is what we find。 This is the average impact rating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: average performance rating in our survey for members， of each of the five clusters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the Y-axis shows the number of standard deviations above or below average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The students performance score， their impact score is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you see the students in the nascent cluster， the average impact there was
    negative one standard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deviations and then on the far right the students in the multi， the 10% of our
    multi's their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: average impact was something like plus one standard deviation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The middle three clusters these are kind of one tool clusters。 The analysts，
    the hammer， the buddy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are one tool clusters are all near average。 They're very close to zero
    standard deviations which means their average impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this of course is a simplification。 These are just the means for each of
    the clusters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those are big clusters so there's going to be a distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I just want to be more clear about that distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is the full distribution of performance scores within each of those clusters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The top is the nascent and you see that even though most of them sit below average
    the highest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: impactful the most， the best performers there actually do reach average and
    get a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit above average。 All the way to the bottom are the multi's and you can see
    that almost all the performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: scores sit above average but then the left tail there are some people in those
    multi's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even though they're using all those tactics that aren't quite having their impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you can see the three one tool factors in the middle all kind of straddle
    that average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: line and you have some folks above and some folks below。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the big result here is the distinction across the five clusters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/993f3d8417a6669757a343760376809d_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: These are big mean differences across the five clusters as a function of how
    many tools they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually using in their influence toolbox。 [ Silence ]。
