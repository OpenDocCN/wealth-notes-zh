- en: So in this section， what we'd like to talk about is that concept I mentioned
    earlier， segmentation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: segmentation and targeting。 And this is a critical idea for marketing and very
    important for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/3886baa732b5b8fda60c6488d0aad9da_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It's called the STP framework， segmentation， targeting and， positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when we get to positioning， that's when we first start getting to branding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is where we're headed。 So the positioning process says you start with
    segmentation with S of STP。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And segmentation says that you identify variables that， allows one to segment
    the market， okay？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to figure out different schemes for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how to break up the market into different market segments。 The second part，
    the T is targeting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You would evaluate the attractiveness of each of these segments and， you choose
    a segment to target。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the third piece is positioning。 Once you get your target segment， you position
    your brand and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your product to meet the needs of that target segment。 STP， segmentation， targeting
    and positioning。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And what I'm putting up on the background now is a slide that shows you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the importance values two different segments have for roof tiles。 So on this
    graphic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see the yellow segment。 Doesn't think price is that important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't care about whether or not it's a low price， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they do care about how attractive the tiles look。 And they really care about
    how durable the tiles are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand， the blue segment， they care a lot about the price。 They want
    a low price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't really care that much about how it looks and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they don't care that much about how long the tiles last。 If you did not segment
    this market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the optimal thing to do would be to give average value to everything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what you would do therefore is not please anybody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The average value here would be not a low enough price for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: '![](img/3886baa732b5b8fda60c6488d0aad9da_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the people who care about durability。 In some sense， I think of that as the
    lukewarm tea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can have hot tea and ice tea and if you give average， it's lukewarm tea
    and nobody's happy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the reasons to segment the market is if you don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you tend to try to reduce costs and go to the average value and， you're not
    meeting anybody's needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going back to that concept of customer focused marketing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I want to give you exactly what you want， I need to segment the market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what you'll see is there's a heterogeneity or differences in preferences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I need to choose or target which one of these segments I want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deliver to and deliver value to that segment。 And for example， in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I delivered durable tiles to the yellow segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they would be willing to pay a higher price for that and I could be very profitable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if I went to a lukewarm thing， I might not sell to anyone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/3886baa732b5b8fda60c6488d0aad9da_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So segmentation means I divide the market up into market segments。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let me just define it formally here。 Market segmentation is the process of dividing
    up the market into distinct subsets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where any subset could conceivably be selected。 And then you pick one of those
    market segments to be your target and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you reach or you deliver to that customer segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that market segment with a distinct marketing mix。 Remember what the marketing
    mix is？ The four P's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product， place， promotion， and price。 And what that says is when I'm looking
    at these different segments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they may want different products。 It may make sense to advertise to them differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may make sense to price differently。 It may make sense to deliver at a place
    decision or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: distribute to them differently。 And so that's the definition of market segment。
    Very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very critical idea in marketing。 So the question is how can I divide up the
    market？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you might understand the idea that I'm going to go after market segments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm going to choose one of them and， then I'm going to give a unique product
    package or marketing mix to one of those segments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe you understand that concept。 But then the question is well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the different ways to segment the market？ And there are actually lots
    of different ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common way that people most usually think about is to divide up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the market on characteristics of the customer。 So intuitively you might think
    about demographics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， men and women like different things。 So let's make a female product and
    a male product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or old people like things that are different than young people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or rich people have different needs than poor people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the segmentation schemes that people frequently think about are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: characteristics of the customer。 Another one though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which doesn't really focus on characteristics of the customer， says well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people like different things than products。 They focus on different benefits。
    So in running shoes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some people care about comfort。 Some people care about aesthetics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people care about technology。 And so it might make sense to divide up the
    market or segment the market on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the benefits that people seek。 A third way to think about it is how do people
    purchase？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe they purchase online。 Some people purchase online。 Some people like to
    go to physical stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people like to use their phones。 Or some people purchase very frequently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people only purchase once a year。 Some people like to switch around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other people like to be loyal。 All of these are different characteristics that
    you can use to segment the market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me just give you a few examples of some of the interesting ways that people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have segmented the market just to give you some ideas。 One of the ones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people talk about demographics。 So they talk about old versus young， male versus
    female。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: city dwellers versus， country dwellers。 Another thing that-- and I'm sure you've
    heard of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may not know it by this term。 Another way to think about it is cohort analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what cohort analysis says， it's not really whether you're young or old。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the life experiences that you've experienced as a cohort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/3886baa732b5b8fda60c6488d0aad9da_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And in particular， it's very important what happens when you're coming of age。
    Right around 14， 15。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 16， 17， 18， those kind of-- those things that hit you at that time， of your
    life are critical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they frame you as a generation。 And so this is the idea you've heard probably
    of baby boomers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a cohort。 Baby boomers were born。 There's two cohorts of baby boomers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's ones that are born about 1950 and then the ones that are born about
    1960。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those-- that cohort of baby boomers all come of age at a certain time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certain things happen when they come of age。 And they react as a generation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generation X is another cohort。 And what you're hearing about nowadays really
    is generation Y。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who are coming of age now， these are the kids who are in college。 They
    think of generation Y。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: millennials。 And why do we really focus on the current generation？ Who's in
    college now？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's that current generation？ Marketers are very interested in the generation
    as they come of age when they're in college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or when they're this age。 Because many times you make purchases at this age
    and then you're loyal to those brands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over time。 So it's-- marketers feel like it's very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very important to get in those people's consideration， sets right at this time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they spend a lot of time studying the cohort of today。 And today's cohort
    is generation Y。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generation Y is very different from all the other generations。 First of all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a generation that was completely brought up on the computer。 They think
    about free content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They think about the social environment。 They're totally comfortable social
    network。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everything's wireless。 They think about things being designed exactly for them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're totally used to customization。 This is a generation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: electronic generation that's quite different from their parents， and from generations
    beforehand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you really need to understand generation Y or the millennials in order to
    market to， them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What they don't like is mass marketing。 They don't like any kind of restricted
    access。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't like things that are going down the beaten path。 They like new。 They
    like different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They like customized。 Millennials are big shoppers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But many times they co-purchase with their parents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the millennials still live with their and are supported by their parents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They think about information electronically。 They are not readers of paper newspapers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't care about print anymore。 They're very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very comfortable multitasking and co-creating with the product。 They're very
    connected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the millennials tend to be socially responsible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you're segmenting the market by cohorts and you decide to target the millennials。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you would have to design a targeted product or position your brand in a specific
    way to。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/3886baa732b5b8fda60c6488d0aad9da_18.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another way that markets tend to be segmented are by geography。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out that people who are similar tend to live together in the same neighborhoods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are different ways to segment。 There's a segmentation scheme called
    PRISM that actually defines the entire country based。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on these geographic clusters。 And they're not defined necessarily about where
    they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you could have a geographic cluster with some characteristic sets in California。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And people who live in New York may be in that same cluster。 So people who live，
    say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in Beverly Hills， California may be similar to people who live， in Scarthdale，
    New York。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those two may be in the same cluster， even though they're separated by 3，000
    miles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the PRISM clustering or ZIP clustering says， if you tell me your ZIP code，
    and I'm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: giving you a United States example， but this kind of notion of geographic segmentation
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: true around the world。 People who are similar tend to live in neighborhoods
    that are similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you tell me where you live。 I have some ideas of the kinds of things
    you might like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the products you might like， the， clothes you might wear， the media you may
    attend to， et cetera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/3886baa732b5b8fda60c6488d0aad9da_20.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And what we find out， and we'll talk about later on in one of the other parts
    of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: program when David Bell comes and talks to you， that it turns out that where
    you live。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: physically also affects your online behavior。 So location is a very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very important variable in thinking about segmentation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are lots of maps that can divide up， say， the New York City， for example，
    into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: a block by block by block segmentation scheme and show different consumer behavior
    by blocks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in New York City。 That's how tight the segmentation geographic segmentation
    can be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you define your segmentation variables， then you need to select a target
    segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what makes a segment attractive？ You need to balance the attractiveness
    of the segment with your capability to deliver。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to that segment。 And you need to constantly monitor whether the actual buyers
    that you're targeting are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: matching what you think that they should be doing。 So how do you pick this segment？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You determine the attractiveness of the segment。 How big is it？ How much growth
    is there？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much money do they have to spend？ How stable is it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these are signs of an attractive segment。 Then you think about， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how good are you at meeting the needs of that segment？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's your current position with respect to that segment？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How easy is it for you to address the needs of that segment？ And then you think
    about， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what about the competition？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/3886baa732b5b8fda60c6488d0aad9da_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: How many people are going after that segment？ What's the strength of the competitors？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So are there potential competitors coming in？ And what you want to do is pick
    the most attractive segment where you have a differential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: advantage over the competition。 That's the best target segment for you to consider。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what you're looking for is you're going to divide the segment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a graph that shows you。 You can have low to high segment attractiveness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can have low to high competitive strength。 And the best segment to go after
    or to target would be the most attractive segment where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are strongest relative to the competition。 That's perfect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes you can't get the perfect segment。 And so you may choose something
    that's a little bit less attractive but still something。
