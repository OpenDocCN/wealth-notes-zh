    and you've。

- en: alerted the operator， you need to find the root cause of the problem。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an example from healthcare might help。 So you get alerted to the following problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A doctor has ordered a lab， but that lab report is not in the medical record
    of the patient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want you to spend two minutes thinking about why your doctor was requested
    a particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lab test to be done by not see the results of the lab test in the patient's
    medical record。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pause the video， take two minutes by yourself， starting now。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So what possible reasons did you come up with？ Well， let me ask you a slightly
    different question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How did you go about the task？ Here's what I did。 I thought about the process
    from the doctor requesting the lab to the doctor seeing the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: labs in the chart。 In my imagination， that process looks something like that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The doctor puts in the lab order。 The patient has to go to the lab。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The lab has to do the test and upload the test results。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the office has to update the chart with the lab results。 So clearly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lots of things can go wrong along the way。 I try to visualize this on this chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these are reasons why the doctor cannot find the lab results in the chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of these reasons are specific to the office， some to the doctor， some to
    the lab。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and some to the patient。 Lots of things that could go wrong。 Let's visualize
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This graph is known as a fishbone diagram。 The reason for that， I hope。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is pretty self-explanatory when you look at the picture。 For less obvious reason。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's also known as an Ishikawa diagram。 Kawoo Ishikawa was a Japanese quality
    guru。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I guess it's what happens when you get famous。 They start naming a graph
    after you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have this fishbone or Ishikawa diagram on the table， you get a team
    of people together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the team can now brain some of why the lab reports are often missing from
    the charts。 Really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fishbone diagram gives this brain-storming some structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's better than just a long laundry list。 Some experts propose to use the following
    labels as the main bones of your fish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machines， methods， materials， manpower， and measurement。 That gives you five
    M's。 Personally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I couldn't care less on how you label the bones of your fish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just label them in whatever way that works for you， but you get the sense here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are multiple potential root causes。 Now， rather than talking about the
    five M's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I won't talk with you about the five Y's。 Sorry， I know that today I'm not sounding
    academically all that vigorous。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but this is pretty helpful stuff。 The five Y's are really a famous quality tool
    that once again go back to Taichiyono。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than just accepting the defect that you just got alerted to， you should
    ask。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Why did this defect happen？"， For example， we can ask， "Why did the lab not
    receive the request？"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， maybe because it was still faxed to them and now 90% of the requests come
    in electronically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next we ask， "Well， why are they still faxing the request？"， Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe that is because at one practice doesn't have the resources to migrate
    everything to electronic data transfer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But why？ So again， you grow the chart and step-by-step you identify additional
    potential root causes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， it is important to know that the fishbone diagram is entirely a mental
    picture of what could have caused the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is really not based on data。 So here's where our second tool for today comes
    in and that is the per-rato chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fishbone diagram lists the potential root causes of the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The per-rato chart lists each of these potential causes and then counts the
    frequency of their occurrence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How many times did that root cause contribute to the failure in the outcome
    variable？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words， here's what you do。 So you look at the last 100 or so charts
    with missing labs and you investigate why the labs were missing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You simply count the frequencies of the root causes and then the per-rato chart
    sorts the root causes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: starting with the most relevant， the most common root cause。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then what you do next is you can capture a line that counts cumulative percentages
    across all those root causes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the common empirical pattern then is that the vast majority of the problems
    can be explained by a very small set of root causes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This pattern is oftentimes known as the per-rato principle or the 80/20 rule。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means that really 20% of the root causes explain 80% of the failures。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that insight is going to be super helpful when you're going eventually going
    to improve the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In that sense， it somewhat resembles the value driver and the KPI trees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I like about the per-rato analysis is that it turns problems solving into
    an empirical exercise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm sure we all have spent counting our sitting and meeting rooms and talked
    about problems and how to fix them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Fishborne diagram gives such a discussion and helpful structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's really the per-rato chart that forces us to collect data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also like the philosophy of the 5-Y framework。 More often than not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the root cause is not at the level of the operator or even at the level of the
    process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You notice that our idea of the root cause of the problem is shifting as we
    continue to ask why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Initially， we want to blame the nurse。 Now we're blaming the hospital management
    for not updating the IT system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As much as I like this framework and the next video， I want to talk about some
    of its limitations。
  prefs: []
