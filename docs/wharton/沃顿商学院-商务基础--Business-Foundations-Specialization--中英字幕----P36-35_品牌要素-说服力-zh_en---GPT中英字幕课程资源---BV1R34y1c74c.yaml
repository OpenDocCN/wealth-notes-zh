- en: So we talked about a bunch of brand images and we talked about creating brand
    perceptions and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how these brand elements work together。 But another part of this brand identity
    is to persuade consumers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's focus now on this process of persuasion or changing people's attitudes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the dominant model that's used in this way of thinking or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the dominant theory is called the elaboration likelihood model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we'll talk a little bit about that。 And then let me focus in on the use
    of celebrity spokespeople because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're used frequently to help persuade consumers to have positive beliefs
    towards a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's start off with persuasion。 What is persuasion？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's an active attempt to change belief and attitude。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So marketers are trying to persuade you to feel favorably towards their， brands
    and their products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The caveat here is that it's difficult and why is it difficult？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's difficult for the reasons that I've mentioned all along。 People expose
    themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pay attention to and interpret data， consistent with what they already believe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And because they're not scientific about it and， evenly sampling and exposing
    themselves to all sorts of different things and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: paying attention to things that both support their prior belief and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: refute their prior belief because they're very biased in the way they take in
    that stimuli。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's hard to persuade them to think differently。 That's not to say it's not
    possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it is difficult。 So the dominant model in thinking about what's the best
    way to persuade consumers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the elaboration likelihood model。 And this model posits that there's two
    different routes to persuasion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's the systematic or central route and， there's the superficial or peripheral
    processing route。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/69a72aaddbc3f34836a1e1283ac37c8c_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The central route says that if people are motivated and they're highly involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they have the opportunity and， the ability to process marketing messages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then the way to persuade them is through central cues in messages。 In other
    words， cognitive cues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things that people have to think about。 Try to make a strong argument。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to make a strong argument， people have to be paying attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have to be motivated and they have to have the ability to process this
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's one way。 Many times， and this is true a lot with marketing decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people just aren't motivated to think that much and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe they just don't want to think that much or maybe they just don't have
    the ability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're too tired or whatever。 In that case， central processing or central route
    to persuasion will not work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you have to use the superficial way， which is to use these peripheral cues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so when your opportunity， motivation， and， ability to elaborate， to cognitively
    process is low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then the way to persuade people is through these peripheral cues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which are more automatic reactions。 People just make decisions based on these
    cues and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not because they thought it out carefully。 So what we're saying here is
    that the consumer is exposed to marketing cues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the first thing is you ask the question， is the consumer motivated to elaborate？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are they going to pay attention and think about your message？ If the answer
    is no， they're not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then that's low involvement。 And then don't give a message they have to think
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: use peripheral cues。 On the other hand， if there's high involvement and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are motivated to elaborate， then the next question you have to ask is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do they have the ability to elaborate？ It's a message。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something that they can figure out if they think about。 And if the answer to
    that is yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you're going to use central route。 If the answer is no。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have to go back to the peripheral route。 Okay， so to get to central routing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the central route where it's systematic， argument。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people have to be motivated and they have to have the ability。 If either one
    of them isn't true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you got to go to peripheral cues。 So what are peripheral cues？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Peripheral cues are cues that people use in a， it's called heuristic way， that
    means a shortcut way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't really think through it。 They just kind of say， well， if this is
    true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then that must be true。 So for example， classical conditioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Classical conditioning says that you persuade people just by putting things，
    together all the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the famous example is Pavlov's dogs。 The dog was conditioned to salivate
    whenever they heard a bell ring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the way it was done is the bell rang before they gave dog food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then every time the dog got dog food， they salivated。 After a while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because of classical conditioning， just the ringing of the bell caused the dog
    to salivate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the same way in marketing， if things are always together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you always have Coke with hamburgers or Coke with McDonald's。 After a while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you don't even think about it。 And you just say， well， I'm having a big Mac。
    Let me have a Coke。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a kind of notion of classical conditioning。 It's not well thought out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just persuaded to have a Coke because I always have had one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reciprocity says that you gave me something IOU。 Now that may make sense and
    may not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you're doing it just because IOU。 So a lot of times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: direct markers will do things like put a little gift， in a charity appeal。 It'll
    give you stamps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or sometimes I give you a dollar。 And the idea is I gave you something。 Now
    you give it back to me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not a cognitive argument。 It's a peripheral cue。 Consistency is another
    peripheral cue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why do you like the toothpaste you use？ A lot of times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the reason that you like the toothpaste you use， is because that's when you
    always use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's when your mother gave you。 It's not like you did the systematic product
    comparison。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you decided this is your favorite toothpaste。 You use it just because you
    always liked it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's consistency as a peripheral cue。 Social proof says， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like this because everybody else likes it。 So New York Times lately has had
    the most emailed articles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People read them。 Why did you read them？ Well， everybody else emailed them。
    There must be good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or my husband chooses restaurants by the one that has the longest line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If everybody's waiting online for this restaurant， that must be good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a social proof peripheral cue。 Liking says， if you like me， then you
    like my ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is very important， and we'll see later for celebrity spokespeople。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you like the celebrity spokesperson， then you're going to like what they
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not necessarily a rational process， but it makes sense in some ways。 Authority
    says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just because I say so， you should do it。 That's another peripheral cue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So because somebody in authority says you should do something， you should do
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not because you thought it out。 It's because it meets your preferences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just because someone told you to do it。 And the last peripheral cue that
    I'll just mention today is this peripheral cue of scarcity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because there aren't very many of them， it must be good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So some marketers use this idea of scarcity to create product quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/69a72aaddbc3f34836a1e1283ac37c8c_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: A modern one that's recently been using that is Lulu Lemon。 And Lulu Lemon purposely
    does not have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， they go to stockouts easily。 If you don't get there quickly， it'll
    run out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the design you might want。 And people infer from that that it's high value，
    high quality product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So all of these are peripheral cues。 Not well thought out， central processing
    arguments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but cues that people use to persuade themselves， of one thing or another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/69a72aaddbc3f34836a1e1283ac37c8c_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So now let's think about celebrity endorsements in terms of these two roles
    of persuasion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in one way that you can use a celebrity in a central processing way。 And
    in that way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the idea is going to be the celebrity is an expert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the reason that the celebrity endorsement matters is because that person
    is an expert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and therefore there's information in that endorsement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Celebrity is a peripheral cue is going to be because the celebrity is attractive
    or because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like the celebrity， then I want to use the products that they use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So celebrities can be used in both ways， either in a central or in a peripheral
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you're thinking about different celebrities to use to help endorse your
    products， there's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: certain things you want to think about。 First of all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who's the target segment and does that target segment like that celebrity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's going to be an important thing。 Then you want to think about what's
    the brand message and does the message of the brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the brand mantra fit the brand message of the celebrity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And another thing you want to think about is how attractive is the celebrity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is this a popular positive celebrity because you don't want to take a celebrity
    that nobody， likes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: obviously。 Other considerations are how costly is it。 Celebrities can be very
    expensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it worth it？ Some of them are cheaper。 Maybe that's a better value for your
    money。 And nowadays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very， very important is the social network。 So some of the celebrities that
    are chosen for endorsement is because they have a very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very strong social network and they have a lot of followers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the clout scores and those kinds of different scores are indicating the
    social。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: connectiveness of these different celebrities。 And all of those go into the
    decision of which celebrity to choose。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's another thing that's out there to rate these different celebrities。
    It's called a Q rating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the Q rating says how appealing is the celebrity among those who do not
    know him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the ratio of popularity and familiarity and it's conducted by a particular
    company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: called Marketing Evaluations。 And you can get Q ratings for different celebrities
    to help you judge which is a good celebrity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and which is a celebrity that maybe isn't as strong and maybe you don't want
    to pay as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much money for or something like that。 So what's the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think you're probably starting to get the idea of how these celebrities work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And formally we think of it as a notion of transfer of meaning and that's the
    model that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: used to indicate the effectiveness of celebrities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the idea is that celebrities have very charged powerful meanings and what
    you want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to do is transfer the meaning of that celebrity to your product。 So advertising
    firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: marketing firms， branding firms try to choose a celebrity that best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: represents the appropriate symbolic properties of the product so that that meaning
    from that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: celebrity will then transfer to the meaning of the product。 And celebrities
    are quite powerful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There have been some FMRI studies that show that when you show an image of just
    a normal， person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: certain areas of the brain light up but if you show an image of a celebrity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different areas of the brain light up。 So there's an automatic or visceral reaction
    to celebrities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They just get more attention and they can be very， very effective at creating
    an image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and at differentiating a brand。 If a celebrity is associated with one brand
    and not another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that can be a very effective， differentiation。 And going back to this elaboration
    likelihood model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you think of the celebrity as， working in a central processing way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we talk about that as having a credible source。 And so in that way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the celebrity is an effective spokesperson because of your expertise and， their
    trustworthiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the very effective at the time spokespeople for Nike was Tiger Woods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now obviously there's been some controversy around Tiger Woods in more recent
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when Tiger Woods was the first spokesperson for Nike Golf， he worked in
    two ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was very credible as an endorser for golf products because he was such a
    successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: golfer and obviously you think there's some expertise in his golfing ability
    and he knows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what he's talking about with regard to product。 That's a central processing
    kind of use of Tiger Woods and that's source credibility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's a credible source。 The other way of thinking about Tiger Woods is he's
    also an attractive source。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People liked him at the time， they were very familiar with him and anything
    he did people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would like。 So he was used as a spokesperson not only for golfing for Nike but
    he's also used for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other products which were not necessarily based on his expertise but just based
    on his。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attractiveness。 And when he got into some scandal and some issues where his
    attractiveness was not as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: strong， some of those endorsements were dropped because he was no longer an
    attractive source。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ones that tended to stay with Tiger were based more on his credibility as
    a source。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/69a72aaddbc3f34836a1e1283ac37c8c_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And you can see when you think about these different methods of persuasion why
    some companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might keep him and some companies might not want to keep him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/69a72aaddbc3f34836a1e1283ac37c8c_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And the ways the celebrities and models are used in these advertisements and
    endorsements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is they can say there's an explicit mode。 They can say I endorse this product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I believe in this product。 There's an implicit mode that says well I use this
    product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's an imperative mode that says well you should use this product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then there just can be these co-presents that celebrities around this product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a lot of product placement， a lot of fashion companies give their celebrities
    their clothes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to wear so that celebrity is just wearing those clothes and that is a kind of
    endorsement。
