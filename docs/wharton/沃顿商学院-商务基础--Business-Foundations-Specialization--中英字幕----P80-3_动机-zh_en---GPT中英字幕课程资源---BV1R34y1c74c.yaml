  prefs: []

    of。

- en: course。 And then you realize that sometimes the employees don't want to do what
    you want them to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And sometimes that's for principal reasons。 And sometimes it's because they're
    having a bad day or they're tired or whatever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the question is going to be how do you get employees to do what you want
    them to， do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I wanted to illustrate with a story that I saw myself in New Orleans in
    a restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many years ago now called Mothers。 And in that restaurant I was there sort of
    a cafeteria line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: great food。 And the electricity went off in the restaurant， but they kept going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which was cool and admirable。 But at the end of the food line you get to the
    point where they total up your bill and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they take your money and give you change。 So there was somebody there with a
    calculator totaling up your bill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there was somebody there at the cash register。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cash register doesn't work because the electricity is off。 Calculators got
    batteries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cash register doesn't， so the cash register is not working。 Cash registers
    are a control device。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ You put in what the food was。 It says how much it was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the day you total that number up and it better correspond with
    the amount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of cash in the drawer or if it's less than that somebody's probably stealing
    or made a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mistake or something。 So we get to the cash register， right？ And it's open。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's somebody there who's taking your money and giving you change， but
    they're just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing it with an open box of cash， right？ Behind that person is another person
    who is standing there just looking over the shoulder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the person who is taking your money and giving you change。 Now what is that
    person doing？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that person is just watching the person with the open cash drawer and probably，
    I'm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assuming I didn't ask them， the reason is because they want to make sure the
    person in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: front of the cash is not stealing cash。 But then you might wonder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shouldn't there be a person standing behind the person who's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: watching the person with the open cash drawer to make sure that they're not
    in coheuts together？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well you start thinking about this and you realize one of the problems of management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you could try to manage people by having somebody stand over and watch them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that doesn't work very well。 First of all， it's really expensive to do。
    Second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how can you trust the person who's watching if you can't trust the first person？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is all around the question of motivation。 How do you motivate people
    to work in the way that you want them to work？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that might include things like not stealing from you。 In general， you can
    think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think this way， I always think about this test。 If your employees are doing
    the right thing for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we talk sometimes also about questions， of engagement now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a common phrase which means really commitment， are they looking after， your
    interest？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it's five o'clock in your office and it's quitting time and it's hit five
    o'clock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the phone's ringing， do people go back and answer the phone or do they continue
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: walk out the door？ If they are committed to the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if they're engaged and looking after your interests。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might take the extra minute or so and answer the phone。 If not， they're
    probably out the door。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as an employer， you want to make sure people will go back in and answer
    that phone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You want to make sure that you can trust your employees with an open cash drawer
    and you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't need somebody standing behind them in order to figure out whether they're
    cheating， or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to talk about how to do that and also understand some of the
    companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that describe how they manage in completely different ways than the example
    of the restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was giving you。 Companies that talk about， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: giving their employees 10 hours a week or so Google， I think was famous for
    this among others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3M as well， to just work on stuff that the， employees want to work on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now they could be sitting on their hands as far as their supervisors probably
    know because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're giving people discretion and you're not supervising them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're giving them autonomy to go do what they want to do that's in the interest
    of the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you really got to trust them。 What makes it possible to trust those people
    in those kind of companies when in lots of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other companies you've got cameras watching people you got supervisors standing
    over them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's different in those two operations？ And we're going to talk about how
    you might make that happen as we go along in this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's start talking about the simplest model of management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a model that is associated with economics people in economics call this
    an agency approach。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: agency model。 The idea here is that you have an agent the employee is like an
    agent who's working for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you and you are the principal that is you are the person who is trying to guide
    the agent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually this is not the way employment works at all but it is a useful abstraction
    to think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about how it works and we're get to the more complicated， more realistic ideas
    in just a， minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have an agent who is working for you how might you motivate that person
    to do the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right thing and you don't want to stand over them and watch them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our course at the Wharton School we teach a case about a company called Automated
    Travel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Systems which was started a while ago and created the software that drives search
    engines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for finding flights now。 And in that company they had a particularly difficult
    moment where their software engineers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were holding the company up。 I mean literally talk about a hold up company that's
    like you're sticking a gun at somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the gun they were sticking is we're going to quit unless you give us more
    money or stock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: options whatever it was。 And in this particular company that was happening the
    engineers were threatening to quit and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the company was on a very short deadline it had investor money that wasn't in
    deep pockets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of money and they had a deadline they had to get to in order to remain solvent
    and the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: engineers are holding them hostage and saying we're going to walk away and your
    project won't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get done unless you give us more money。 Well this is a problem with this kind
    of basic model where it's all about money and we are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can hold you up for more money because we don't really care about the mission
    of the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we don't really care about our job we're just in it for the money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how you solve that problem basically is unfortunately going to be that you
    can't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do it with simple contracts you're going to have to do other things as well
    and we'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come back to that in just a couple minutes。 But the basic idea about incentives
    is the solution to the agency problem as it usually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: describes you're trying to reward people for doing the right thing you want
    them to finish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this project they get paid so much when they finish a project think about it
    almost like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a contractor right now there's a couple of other ideas around this simple model
    one of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them is something that economists call efficiency wages and the idea here is
    about kind of about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relative competition that if you pay more than your competitors even if it's
    only a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit more you will get better workers first of all because if they can choose
    where to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: go the best ones will come to you if you pay a little premium over everybody
    else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second factor is that those folks are less likely to quit because where
    they're going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to go if your job is better than everybody else's and the third is they're likely
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: behave better because if they don't they might get fired and they lose a job
    which is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: better than everybody else's job。 So basically it's the advantages of having
    a job that on balance is better than the ones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your competitors have got and there's pretty clear evidence on that I did one
    of these studies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a while ago showing the discipline rates were actually lower at plants where
    companies were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: paying a little premium above the market rate。 Now you got to pay more for that
    but the idea is because you're paying a little better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than everybody else you get lots of benefits。 Now the obvious question is what
    happens if everybody else starts paying more and then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the benefits go away right so it's all about relative competition and the idea
    of a tournament。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as a way to structure pay is another kind of economics based argument that is
    about relative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compensation and this mimics the way sports tournaments work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f471c08626e7914fab1fbbd5338d13af_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So for example if you're a golfer or somebody playing an individual sport you'd
    know that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you win the tournament you get a big prize the people coming in second get
    something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's pretty good the third you get a little trophy and fourth place you get
    a carry on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bag and that's about it as you work your way down the big prizes are for winning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now why is that a good thing because you could have many people playing in the
    tournament。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all motivated by that one prize and that makes it a very efficient way to do
    things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course there are downsides to this as well and the downsides are that this
    works great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a tournament where nobody's going to work together and everybody's literally
    competing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: against each other but inside an organization where these tournament models
    are set up they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: usually promotion systems so if you get promoted to partner you make a ton more
    than the people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who are associates。 If you get promoted to the next level up in a company particularly
    to the CEO level you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make a ton more money than the people just below you it motivates lots of people
    along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way but if you want people to cooperate and work together in a company or
    in a professional。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: service firm it cuts against that it creates incentives for you to fight each
    other and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it also creates incentives for you to join week tournaments that is you don't
    necessarily。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to be in a tournament full of stars because it's going to be hard to win
    you want to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a tournament with a lot of losers because then it's easier for you to win
    so it affects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where people want to go as well plus is and minus is to efficiency wages plus
    is and minus。
