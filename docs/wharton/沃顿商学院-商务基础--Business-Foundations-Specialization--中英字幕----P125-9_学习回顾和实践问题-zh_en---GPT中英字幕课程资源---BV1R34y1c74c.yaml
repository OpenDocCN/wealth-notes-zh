  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I will keep my word， but first， I want to annoy you with some rather earthly
    calculations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to first repeat the definitions that we have covered until now in this
    module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the set of videos we talked about the labor content， the cycle time， the
    idle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the labor utilization， and the cost of direct labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also talked about the idea of line balancing。 Now that we have arrived at
    the end of this module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want you to be comfortable computing the cycle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finding the labor content and the labor utilization， and computing the cost
    of direct labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should also be able to determine how long it takes to produce X units starting
    with an empty system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And finally， you should now be able to find tech time and the target manpower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well to think about some process improvement strategies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Down here you see the key formulas that you will need to remember from this
    module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem I have chosen for this module is Mr。 Kears， here's someone。 Mr。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: K is a problem that's somewhat similar to the sub-work case in the sense that
    there are multiple activities that are done by a set of workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me emphasize that there are five activities。 There are five activities，
    not five workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three workers and five activities， and the five activities are spread
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as you can see in the question。 As usual， I want you to put me on hold while
    you're tackling the problem by yourself first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So pause now。 Alright， here we go again。 We start by looking at the bottleneck。
    And for that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we draw a simple process flow diagram。 So we have a box for the first worker
    or a triangle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a box for the second worker， another triangle， and a box for the third worker。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So then it's our process flow diagram。 And then for the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need to find the capacity level， and that requires computing the processing
    times first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The processing times we are at 10 minutes per guess at the first， 20 at the
    second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and 30 minutes per guess at the third resource。 And to get to the capacity level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we do is we're going to take M divided by the processing time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And since it's a one worker per station， it's simply one divided by the processing
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it is one divided by 10 as a capacity for the first resource， one by 20，
    one by 30。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is now expressed in guess per minute。 Alright。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that makes it clear that the third resource is going to be the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that answers our question。 Next， let's look at average labor utilization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mentioned in the module two ways of finding the average labor utilization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so let me illustrate how both of them would work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The labor utilization we said is labor content， which is a sum of the processing
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divided by three times the cycle time。 Okay， so what does this mean？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The labor content is 10 plus 20 plus 30， the sum of the processing time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's 60 minutes per unit。 And we're going to be on a 30 minute cycle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so three times 30 is 90 minutes， which gets us a 66% labor utilization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the other way that I mentioned in the video， we could compute the same thing
    by looking at the labor content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then divide it by the labor content plus the idle time。 Now again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're on a 30 minute cycle here， and so that means that my first resource has
    a 20 minutes of an idle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: processing time is 10 minutes， and the cycle time is 30， so 20 minutes of an
    idle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second one has 10 minutes of idle time， and the third one is zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that means we have a total idle time of 30 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So 60 divided by 60 plus 30 is going to be my labor utilization。 Same result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then finally at the wage rate of $20 per hour， what is the cost of direct
    labor per customer？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For that， we have to look at three people， each make 20 bucks per hour， so it's
    $60 per hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're going to divide it by the floor rate。 We're serving two guests per
    hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's our floor rate。 And so the per hour is going to cancel out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're going to get a cost of direct labor that is $30 per guest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's the next batch of questions。 How long would it take the process to serve
    10 customers starting out empty？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， let's think about that。 How long would it take to serve one customer？
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's going to be 10 minutes at the first resource， the first employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 20 minutes at the second employee， 30 minutes at the third employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so after 60 minutes we're going to have our first customer out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From then onwards we need to serve nine more， and those nine are going to come
    out at the rate of the cycle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is 30。 So 60 plus nine times 30， and that gives us 330 minutes。 All right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how could this process be improved by offloading the bottling？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that question kind of gives the way the answer， so we have to move work away
    from the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we saw the bottleneck was station number three， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so when you look at the activities here， station number three is doing the
    hair。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also spending five minutes here on the checkout。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you could move these five minutes to somebody who has less work to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the key suspect I guess here is going to be station number one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you would offload the bottleneck。 So in short， what you would be doing here
    is you would move five minutes of work from station number three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the third employee， which is currently the bottleneck， and this is going to
    be super busy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're going to take these five minutes to station number one who really has
    nothing to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That doesn't always work because it might be precedence relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a good move you should consider。 All right， what's the tack time that we
    need to achieve if we want to have 40 customers per day served？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember， when we look at tack time， we look at the available times of 10 hours
    or 600 minutes per day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're going to divide it by the demand rate， which we said is a target demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we said that this year 40 customers per day。 So the per day cancels out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we have 600 by 40 that is 15 minutes between customers。 That's going to
    be our tack。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to be serving a customer every 15 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the tack time intern allows us to compute the target manpower。 For the target
    manpower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: remember we have to look at the labor content， and the labor content divided
    by the tactics simply going to give us a target manpower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， labor content， we already computed there was 60 minutes per customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're going to divide it by the 15 minutes per customer that we just computed
    as a tack。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that means at the very minimum， if everything goes super smoothly and there's
    no idle time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to need a total of four employees。 My philosophy， the observation
    of today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relates to the difference between project management and process management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of you likely have experience with managing a project。 You define activities，
    set an end goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you look for something known as a critical path。 Recently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I heard an interesting quote from Elon Musk。 Think of Elon Musk whatever you
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but Tesla and SpaceX are arguably remarkable businesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Elon was talking a bit about his favorite topic， which is flying to Mars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He said flying to Mars is more of a D-day operation than it is an Apollo mission。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me repeat this。 Flying to Mars is more of a D-day operation than it is an
    Apollo mission。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What did he mean？ The Apollo was an amazing project with a single mission and
    a historical success。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Personally， I don't remember it。 I was exactly 100 days old when that happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Land a man on the moon。 Though ultimately， multiple people walked on the surface
    of the moon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the entire management focus of the Apollo mission was on landing one man on
    the moon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mission of D-day and the invasion of Normandy by the Western Allied forces
    was different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was not about landing one boat in Normandy。 On June 6， 1944， the Americans。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: British and the French began sending over 150，000 soldiers to Normandy coastline。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The focus of management was not to build a boat or build a plane。 It was building
    many of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Process management ultimately only makes sense if you are repeating something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Elon Musk doesn't want to build one rocket to fly to Mars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He intends and in fact has even started to build many starships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: His dream is to establish a colony on Mars。 For management problems， so you
    only do something once。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should take a course on project management。 If however you want to do something
    multiple times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have to think about process flows。 For most of us， I propose。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: planning a wedding is a project you plan for one marriage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The wedding planner in contrast thinks that weddings is a process。 Other examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more units flow through the process， the easier would it be to use process
    analysis as a tool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When in the late 1800s， Gottlieb Diamond built the first car。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast when Dr。 Daniel Williams preferred to perform the first heart surgery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he most likely thought of it as a project。 So you see that when work gets repeated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we move from the first units to the end unit。
  prefs: []
