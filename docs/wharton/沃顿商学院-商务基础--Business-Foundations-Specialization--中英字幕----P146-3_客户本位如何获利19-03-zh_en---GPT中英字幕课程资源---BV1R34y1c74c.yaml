- en: Let me remind you of where we've been and then talk about where we're going
    for the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: remainder of my portion of the course。 So here's where we've been。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've been talking about customer centricity。 We've been motivating it by the
    fact that the traditional product centric model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: while， it's still common， still the way the most businesses operate， there are
    some cracks in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product centricity。 Issues like commoditization， well-informed customers， globalization
    and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that just， takes some of the edge off of product centricity。 And so customer
    centricity is emerging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems to be a promising alternative， but it's not well understood。 So people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies are using a lot of different words for it， whether it's customer intimacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether it's customer centricity， customer focus， people are using a lot of
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: words and people are implying a lot of different concepts。 For me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've offered a very clear definition of what customer centricity means and why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies would want to consider it。 And for me， the key to customer centricity
    is the celebration of customer heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an acknowledgment that customers are different from each other and instead of
    viewing that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as a nuisance， oh， we have to treat them differently， it's an opportunity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a terrific opportunity to say， hey， some customers are more valuable than
    others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's really focus on them to create and extract some of that value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's find more customers like them。 And let's find ways to continue to have
    relationships with the other customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but not necessarily， on the same terms as those really focal customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And at the heart of that argument was the concept of customer lifetime value，
    the idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we're going to judge the goodness of a customer， not so much on the amount
    of money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or value that we've already extracted from that customer， but from the amount
    of money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or value that we think we can extract and will extract in the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's this future looking idea。 We're going to judge customers based on what
    we think they will be worth to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's just really critical and we're going to continue to really focus
    on how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that forward looking， seal the orientation is going to affect and in some cases
    radically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: change the kinds of decisions we make about how we run our business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I mentioned very briefly some of the tactics that we tend to focus on are
    things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like customer acquisition， customer retention， customer development。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I haven't given a lot of specifics yet about how we manage those tactics，
    how we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gauge our success at those tactics and how we balance them off against each
    other in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: order to really understand our customers and again create and extract all that
    value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what we're going to be doing now。 So this module is all about show me
    the money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This module is all about how to really， really understand acquisition， retention
    and development。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a very new way because as I've said before those tactics by themselves aren't
    new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies have been acquiring customers。 They've been retaining and increasing
    the value of customers for a long。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long time。 But we want to elevate the importance of those ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to develop metrics and managerial guidelines to really understand those
    tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: better and drive the business using them。 Not just using them at the margin
    to squeeze a few more dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're really going to dive deep into acquisition， retention and development。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what this module is all about。 Ideally a company aspires to be world
    class on all three of those dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acquisition， retention and development。 But that's tricky。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact it's tough enough to master any one of them， much less two or even three
    of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what we're going to do is we're going to examine them one at a time but we
    do want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to understand the interplay among them。 We do want to understand some of the
    trade-offs that companies face。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact I want to begin by asking you about one of those trade-offs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's imagine that you're running a company， many of you are or you're involved
    with a， business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you're out there， you have your marketing budget and you're spending it
    appropriately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on acquisition， retention， development。 But then the CEO comes down and says，
    "You know what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to give you an extra， dollar or $100，000。 You get the idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to give you a little bit of extra money。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which one of those three tactics are you going to spend it on？ No， there's all
    three are important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But at the margin， which one do you think is most deserving of that incremental
    dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you might have？ In fact， I really want you to think about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to make this a little quiz question。 So in fact I'll pause for a second
    and I want you to vote。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay？ So I'm counting。 So I want you to raise your hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So which one is the most important tactic at the margin？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how many of you would say it's customer acquisition？ Okay？ How many say customer
    retention？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Raise them high so I can see。 Okay。 And how many say customer development？ Okay，
    got it。 All right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I've tallied up your votes here and it looks like approximately 5% of you
    voted for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer acquisition。 And of the rest of you， the remaining 95%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it looks like it's a pretty even split。 So 47。5% for customer retention， 47。5%
    for development。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At least when I ask this question to students， to managers， to senior executives，
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies all around the world， that's the basic split that I get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the attention seems to be on retention and development and just a few
    odd balls who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are saying we should spend that extra dollar on acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm going to come up with a crisp answer to that question。 Okay？ I don't
    like it depends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to say at the margin， which one of those would be most important for
    our ongoing， activities？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's what I want to do。 Let's dive into each one of these three tactics
    and understand it really carefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but understand， it in a new way。 Because again， the basic words acquisition
    retention development aren't new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but how do we see them， differently when we look at them through the lens of
    customer centricity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or more specifically， how do we see them differently in a world where we're
    celebrating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: heterogeneity？ Okay？ So that's the theme that's been running through my portion
    of the course so far and will continue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because now we're going to see the big payoff from that celebration of heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's what I'm going to do。 For each one of those tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to lead by asking the same question and then， we're going to dive
    deeper from there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's the question。 Let's start with customer acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What metric do firms use to gauge and guide their acquisition activities？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because there's a lot of different metrics out there that firms use to evaluate
    how well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're doing different parts of their operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when we look at customer acquisition in particular， what's the metric that
    tells us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how well we're doing and gives us a forward-looking indication of how well we
    think we'll be doing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now for some of you， you might need to even have a readily available metric
    for it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But for many of you， especially those of you， or firms that work in the digital
    world， very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: often I ask this question and I'll come up with the answer to it right away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it comes in the form of three letters。 CPA。 CPA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about there。 Cost per acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many firms gauge and guide their acquisition activities based on CPA， cost per
    acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the reasons why they do it is because it's just so visible， especially
    in this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: day and age where it's much easier to track not only the behavior of customers
    after we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acquire them， but the cost of acquiring them in the first place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So so many companies out there are constantly looking at their CPA and trying
    to think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways to lower it。 How can we get that CPA down？ How can we bring in more customers
    for the same number of dollars？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again， many of you who are out there working， especially focusing on marketing
    or customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acquisition activities in particular know what I'm talking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But here's the important point that I want to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Focusing your business using CPA to gauge and guide your acquisition activities
    is a big。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: big mistake。 I'm not just saying that it's an imperfect measure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm saying that it's actually a grossly misleading measure if you're using that
    to guide your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acquisition activities。 So that's a very radical statement and I want to explain
    myself how I come up with that logic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what you should do about it。 So let me step back for a second and focus
    on issues that I've raised previously。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which， is the idea of thinking about our customers as assets， right？ Our customers
    are assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many cases， that's the most important asset that we have。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not necessarily saying that we're going to put customers formally on the
    balance， sheets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: although there's a lot of discussion about doing just that， taking customer
    equity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and really using it as a formal measure。 I don't necessarily care about the
    accounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we all agree that customers are assets。 So to the extent that customers
    are assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do you think about using a CPA-type metric， when it comes to acquiring
    assets？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about other assets that we acquire。 How about employees？ How about technology？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How about lawyers？ Think about those kinds of assets that firms depend upon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'd never hear a firm say something like， "Well， she was a lousy lawyer， but
    she was， cheap。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay？ When it comes to lawyers， when it comes to employees， what are firms looking
    for？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're looking for the best， not necessarily the cheapest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why is it that we use this cost-oriented mentality when it comes to our customers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So my question is， instead of focusing on CPA， what is it that firms should
    be focusing， on instead？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about that for a second。 Instead of CPA， what should it be？ Say it all
    together with me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Exactly。 VPA， value per acquisition。 We should be focusing on the upside that
    the customers can provide to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the way， if you just think about the notion of value per acquisition， what
    does that sound。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot like？ An idea that we've already discussed。 Of course， that's CLV， customer
    lifetime value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's think about the upside potential that customers have， and then use
    that number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to drive the CPA。 Okay？ So we're going to kind of flip the equations around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way of thinking about customer lifetime value， and certainly this is the
    way a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of textbooks present it， and the way a lot of companies think about it， is that
    they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say CLV represents the upper bound。 I'm willing to spend up to that amount to
    acquire a customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Makes sense， right？ I certainly don't want to spend more than that because I'm
    losing money on the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the CLV is basically a ceiling。 I'm willing to spend up to that amount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's what I want managers and companies to think about。 Here's the ceiling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what I think the customer will be worth。 How much of that money am I
    willing to spend to acquire that customer？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then how much of that money do I want to keep and give to my shareholders
    as current。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and future profits？ So when it comes to thinking about customer acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't want to focus on floors。 I don't want to focus on how low can we bring
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to focus on ceilings instead。 Okay？ I want to understand how high we
    can go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm not saying that we should necessarily spend every penny up to CLV， but
    we're not aspiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to spend more money。 That's ridiculous。 What the point is that if we focus on
    the ceiling instead of the floor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll be willing to spend， a little bit more money at the margin and more importantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get better customers in the， process。 So let me give you a very specific example。
    So as I said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the digital marketing world， the CPA is so tangible。 It's so observable to
    us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any company that's working with Google， for instance， is thinking very carefully
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what they're spending for every keyword on Google sponsored search。 And they're
    wondering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Should we be spending $4。50 to get someone through this keyword， or， should
    we be spending $4。49？"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you'll have all these arguments about pennies， about CPA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so there's a couple of companies that are getting smart about it and saying，
    "You， know what？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of focusing exclusively on what we're paying to get those customers，
    let's look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at what we're getting out of those customers after we acquire them。"， In other
    words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's look at the CLV of customers who we acquire through different kinds of
    marketing， activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so over here you can see a screenshot of just one article。 It's just， I
    think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a very nice typical example of an article and you can see just from the， title
    alone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is let's understand the CLV， the lifetime value of the customers whom we've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acquired through Google sponsored search。 And let's understand how their CLV
    is different than customers whom we acquire through other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: channels。 And so， well， given you all the details of the study， here's the highlight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it tells us that as we sit back and we look at the data that we've collected
    on customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acquired through different kinds of marketing activities， those who were acquired
    initially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through Google sponsored search are worth， on average， CLV of about $1，000，
    whereas customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acquired through other channels are worth about $200 less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here we are arguing about pennies or dimes， small amounts of money about
    how much we should。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be spending to acquire customers。 But we find out that there are these huge，
    dramatic differences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hundreds of dollars difference， if we use one kind of tactic instead of another。
    And CLV is the key。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CLV shows us that there's so much more value lying in our customers that we
    don't necessarily。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: appreciate。 And when we have this cost orientation， not only we don't appreciate
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we'll never， realize it。 We'll never actually be able to put it in our pocket。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I really like this example。 And I wish that this example were more rural
    than exception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we said a lot of companies would kind of step back and do this kind of analysis
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their existing customers。 And it's not only a matter of doing it for， say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google sponsored search versus everything， else， you can do it any which way。
    You can say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's look at customers who we acquired at one time period versus another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's look at customers who we acquired through one geographic area versus another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's look at customers whose first product purchased from us was one kind of
    product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: versus another。 Let's look at customers who we acquired through one marketing
    campaign or another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we constantly want to be tagging our customers， understanding different characteristics
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how and when and where we acquired them。 And then with the little patience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's match that information up with what these customers， proved to be worth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we're going to run some CLV models。 We need to wait a little bit of time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to collect more data on them to understand which customers or which
    groups of customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are the most valuable ones。 But by doing so， we can really understand those
    sources of value and get just some great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: guidance about where we should be spending our next marketing dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me summarize this thinking about customer acquisition。 Most and foremost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want to avoid having a CPA mentality。 And I mean that not only kind of in
    a jokey way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because of course I'm also referring， to CPAs being certified public accountants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want to think about being counting。 We don't want to think about pennies
    when it comes to acquiring customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to focus on ceilings instead of floors when it comes to how we're going
    to spend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to acquire customers。 And the celebration of how to rejuvenate is that by understanding
    the CLV differences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across customers， that's going to give us some direct ideas about where we should
    be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: spending the money。 And when we understand where the more valuable customers
    tend to come from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's invest， much more heavily in those search words and those channels and
    those marketing campaigns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no guarantee that every customer that we get through those activities
    are going， to be good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact， that's not true at all。 We're always going to get a mix of customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The metaphor that I like to use is that we're always fishing for our customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is going to give us some idea of where we should be throwing the lines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when we throw the lines or when we throw out the nets， we're going to always
    pull in。
  prefs: []
