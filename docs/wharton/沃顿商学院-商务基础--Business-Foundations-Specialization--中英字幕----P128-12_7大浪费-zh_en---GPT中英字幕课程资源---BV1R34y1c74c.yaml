- en: The OE framework has helped us to look at a resource and separate a waste from
    value at。

- en: time。 In this session， it's talking a bit more about what waste looks like。
    According to Atei Giono。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there exists seven sources of waste。 Already introduced the key idea in the
    last session。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moving is not working。 So as we look for waste， it is not just the idle resource
    that provides the opportunity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beeziness per se is not a virtue。 A piece of equipment might be highly utilized
    or an employee might always be overworked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but that is no guarantee that the process or the employee is adding value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start by going back to the Taylor quote。 Remember we talked about awkward，
    inefficient or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: indirect movements of man？ While your awkward， inefficient and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: indirect operations professor will not define seven sources of waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first way I want to define is wasted motion。 It's unnecessary movement of
    people during their work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just changed the tire of my bike this morning。 It took me probably twice as
    long as it takes the skilled bike mechanic down the street from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here。 And so that is a form of wasted motion。 The same is really true for a
    chef。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I love watching chefs in the kitchen。 Every motion adds value， there's no fumbling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's no pausing。 It's just perfection。 That's just not me。 The second way
    relates to defects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Defects are obviously not adding value。 They're really annoying for the customer
    if they remain undetected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you detect the defect within the boundaries of your process， they require
    you fixing them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something that is known as rework。 So defects are a second source of waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over processing is a third source of waste， which relates to producing a higher
    quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than what is needed or demanded by the customer。 It's like serving a fancy meal
    to your relative who only eats cheeseburgers or maybe with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my German family only loves part worst。 So now we are up to three。 Motion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over processing and defense。 All of those three can be found by looking at one
    resource in isolation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To see the other four sources of waste， we really have to move beyond one worker
    performing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one task and look at the process and many workers in a line。 Just think back
    to the sub-break case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the three persons making a sandwich every 46 seconds。 As you switch to looking
    at the process now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we typically encounter idle time。 Some resources by definition have more capacity
    than the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so they will incur， idle time。 Now， all we refer to idle time is waiting
    as the workers really waiting for the floor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unit， the part。 Personally， I like idle time better because I don't want to
    confuse it with customers waiting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a resource。 But again， all we call it waiting and to remind to criticize
    the God of operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next there's inventory。 If the floor is not well coordinated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of the resources will produce faster than the， others。 In particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's going to be the bottleneck， it's going to be the slowest step， and we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to end up with inventory in the process and typically in front of the
    bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is our fifth source of waste。 Inventory also happens when we produce more
    than what is demanded by the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We go back to our discussion of tech time and its role of keeping us in sync
    with demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Uno named this overproduction and he made it the sixth source of waste。 And
    finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as we have multiple resources in the process， we have to move the floor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unit from one resource to the other， which is known as transportation。 So here
    they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: seven sources of waste。 Again， more to come in future videos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I wanted to introduce a framework first。 Let me make two observations。 First。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how do you remember these seven sources of waste？ They are really multiple memory
    tricks out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the one I like the best is Tim Wood。 Tim Wood simply combines transport，
    inventory， motion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: waiting， overprocessing， overproduction， and defects。 I know it's somewhat stupid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but at least for me， it has always worked。 And then second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the operations community now increasingly refers to an eight source， of waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's a waste of intellect， which means not using the ideas of those working，
    in the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is a wasted opportunity and thus an eight source of waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We talk more about involving the workers and future discussions on quality。
    At this point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think back to the comment I made on tailorism at the beginning of this， module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the 20 years that I've been doing consulting work and research collaborations
    with companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've always been amazed how universally applicable the seven sources of waste
    end up being。 Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: waste really might look different in each industry。 Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this framework has its root in manufacturing。 It also works well in other settings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: including healthcare。 I show you some examples here on this slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find it almost shocking how directly the seven sources of waste apply to healthcare。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and similar settings。 Rework in healthcare is called readmissions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hospitals have a whole department called patient transports， rooms， equipment
    and providers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are at times idle as we discussed at the beginning of the module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And don't get me started on overproduction， the provision of unnecessary procedures
    by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the providers。 Anyway， I'm sure you have seen these things in one form or the
    other in your own experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now spotting waste really requires careful observation。 In the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this has mostly been done by stop watching people。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've done some work myself using a method called time and motion studies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I did is I video recorded primary care providers and then I would dissect
    the encounters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they had with their patients， second by second with the help of some medical
    experts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and other doctors to look for waste。 This would give us a sense on how doctors
    are spending their time with patients。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was fascinating to me to see how little time was spent on actual examinations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such data collection is obviously very tedious。 However。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you show up with either a video camera or a stopwatch to collect data，
    chances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are that you're not really getting representative data from the operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me make two observations on how such time and motion studies are changing
    as we're moving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: along in history。 First， most service operations these days are really digitized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so oftentimes you can get timestamp data from the operations， particularly
    call centers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: claim processing， customer support or reading x-rays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all these processes are something that I refer to as digital exhaust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such processes store when an employee touches a record and how long they work
    on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b3618623e4221540e984ee5f64bb67fd_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: That allows you to compute the processing times even years after the work has
    happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taylor's claim of movement leaving nothing tangible behind is simply no longer
    true in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our modern digital world。 Second， we now really have technology to use image
    processing and AI to do this observation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for us。 To help illustrate， I've been working with a startup run by two pen
    grads。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these guys have developed machine vision technology that helps manufacturing
    firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to measure processing times， spot waste and detect quality problems via video
    cameras。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are installed at the assembly line。 What you see here is the assembly line
    of pride mobility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pride is making high-end wheelchair。 A business also run by a warden grad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the video footage here on this slide shows you line segment 170， which consists
    out of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some manual assembly operation。 And you notice that the image recognition of
    the software is tracking the flow unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is the wheelchair。 And it's also tracking the resource。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is the gentleman here in the white t-shirt。 And then the software is smart
    enough to spot when the worker is idle or the worker is spending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more time on the flow unit as usual。 All this data is then fed into a reporting
    system that spits out the report that looked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like this。 Now， I'm sure you've seen this in your own life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is really more and more 1984 George Orwell than is emerging in our society。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it does matter if you drive a modern car， serve the internet or go for a
    walk with your， phone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's also said we now do， can be tracked and leaves a data trail behind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is certainly worthy of a longer discussion about privacy and individual
    freedoms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're interested in this topic， I make sure to provide a link to some work
    I've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: been doing in this space。 I do however think that these various tracking technologies
    will and should play an increasing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: role in operations management。 In the previous video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we defined the OEE as a percentage of time that the resource is， doing what
    it is designed to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now， waste was an abstract enemy that was somehow reducing our OEE。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The seven sources of waste framework helps us to see how exactly we waste capacity。
    Tim Wood。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in other words， is the main enemy to a lean operations。 In the next video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to switch the perspective and talk about the view of the flow unit， be。
