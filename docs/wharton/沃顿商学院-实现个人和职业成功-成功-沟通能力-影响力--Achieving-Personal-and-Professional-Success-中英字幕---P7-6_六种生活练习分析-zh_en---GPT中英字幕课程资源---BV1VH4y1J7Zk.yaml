  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the top。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of your list or near the bottom and there might be some insights that you can
    gain from this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first life on the list is the teacher。 The teacher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you chose the teacher as your number one life， I think it often signals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a very passionate perspective on being a mentor， being involved in a small setting
    where you。

    story the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: person who's the teacher has one child who has become estranged from their family。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to them and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it feels like there's kind of fracture in the home life of this story and people
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very reluctant to endorse that as a successful life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes the people who point to that factor feel that the teacher has a little
    bit of incomplete。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the sense that they seem to be able to throw themselves at helping others
    in their work。
  prefs: []

    been able。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    well it wasn't。

    they don't。
  prefs: []

    to find is that your own experience tends to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you'll kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    way to get back together again then I think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are more of a believer in the healing process and that part of that life
    feels like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's something that can be solved。 At the very least if you ranked it high consider
    this a sort of signal about your motivations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for working in smaller groups to affect the lives of others and to bring out
    other people's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talents。 Number two life is the banker。 The banker is a single woman with a
    child who has a severe disability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She has no partner in her life， adult partner and is a dedicated loyal professional
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a rather successful career in wealth management。 She has turned her family situation
    into an asset as she has become a marathon runner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She's used her running to facilitate a sort of a cause for children with disabilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She wheels her kid with her on her marathon runs in a device that she's gotten
    specially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rigged up and gets publicity for the cause。 So people who pick this life number
    one often salute this person's autonomy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: her choices。 All her friends are saying that she should put her child in a home
    or in a facility and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get on with her life and her reaction is no no this is my life。 This is provides
    meaning for me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you feel the courage of the position that she's taken and her certainty
    and confidence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in it。 People who pick this life down near the bottom see this sort of the burden
    aspect of having。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a child with a severe disability as a defining characteristic of this person's
    life as a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little too narrow。 And they feel like this would not be a life they would choose
    because it seems she doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to be married。 She doesn't she devoted herself to this one person in her
    life and it seems kind of restricted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to them。 So again if you're one of your highest values is loyalty devotion to
    family then this life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looks a little more appealing if you're thinking more about autonomy and a career
    or a life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with lots of options and the ability to travel extensively and so on。 This one
    doesn't look so good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you know none of them are the right or the wrong answer they're just different
    values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that people elicit when they have to answer these questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So life number three is the wealthy investor。 Now among all the lives the wealthy
    investor is the one who has first of all the most autonomy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The person made a great deal of money on an early investment in their career。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've then been able to turn to investing that money and to providing themselves
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the means of carrying out all kinds of hobbies and causes。 They love hang gliding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have lots of travel in their lives lots of freedom and then they can even
    get involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in political causes so they give some of their money to political causes that
    they believe， in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they're having a lot of impact on the world around them outside of their
    little intimate， sphere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who pick this life way down at the bottom instead of focusing on all
    the freedom and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: autonomy look at this life and say this person looks lonely。 They've been married。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It didn't work out。 They've never remarried。 They have no children。 They have
    no family。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's discernible from the story and so there's this big missing piece for
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now again I actually got an email from an MBA student recently who picked this
    life and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: said that this life was very appealing to her because freedom is a value that
    she。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: esteemes above all others。 She was actually coming to Wharton from a country
    where freedom was not always an assumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that she could count on。 So when she got here this life felt very appealing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other people on the other hand choose this life at the bottom because no family，
    no family。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: only kind of an emotional deficit。 Okay， so that's number three。 Moving on to
    number four。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Stone Mason。 So in many ways the Stone Mason's life is the opposite of their
    wealthy investor's life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a man who has a family， has been married for decades to the same partner，
    has， children。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of whom have gone on to do completely different careers than he has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He builds homes with stone。 They've gone on to be lawyers and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He describes his life in very almost mystical terms。 He sees his day as very
    much under his control。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He has a kind of craftsman's like ability to just find just the right stone
    and put it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in just the right place。 He's built homes for his children and he can drive
    through his town and see the homes he's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: built。 And so there's a lot of coherence in this life and people who pick it
    near the top are inclined。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to salute that sort of embrace of family， embrace of craft， embrace of controlling
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experience they're having in their life。 Very integrated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who pick it down near the bottom often see this as a life with very little
    scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This person is only affecting their family。 They're only affecting a few people
    in their community with the homes they build。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He builds and they want to have a bigger impact on the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Plus there seems to be no recognition outside of this person to his skill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's not even an award from Stonemason Weekly that he was Stonemason of
    the week。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's just an average guy who builds pretty good homes。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if your success values are more oriented toward the family， toward integration，
    then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this one's going to rank very high。 If they're oriented more toward impact on
    others and scale as well as a sort of autonomy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and options， then this one doesn't seem quite as appealing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I did have one executive once comment to me about this life because in a class
    I might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pick one person who picked it number one and they described why they liked it
    and one person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who picked it number six and they described why they didn't。 It was in a big
    group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a hundred people in the room and someone who just described the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stonemason in rather disparaging terms and why they picked it number six。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This man stood up in the back of the room and I think he was from a very strong
    spiritual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: background because he stood and said， "The Stonemason is having a tremendous
    effect， on society。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Stonemason is building a society as he builds his homes and that he is the
    foundation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for his family。"， So this very poetic view of the implications and the symbolism
    for this life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyway， this is one that elicits a lot of different emotions from people when
    they take， it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Life number five is the tennis pro。 Now the tennis pro of all of the different
    lives is the one person that actually appeared。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the cover of a magazine。 It's clear that she is a very accomplished professional
    on the circuit and has been acknowledged。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and recognized for this very important accomplishment and is so therefore has
    this sort of success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the traditional sense very， very well outlined and defined。 She also has
    a family partner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They couldn't have children of their own so she adopted children。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She has a little tennis camp that she's running that gives underprivileged kids
    a chance to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experience tennis and learn the skills that come with that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people who like this life put it higher often focus on all those attributes
    and have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a very positive feeling for the combination of things that she's bringing to
    her life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand， people who rank it down to the bottom point to other aspects
    of this， vignette。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of which is she complains that she's so busy with her profession that she
    doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have time to be with her kids as much as she would like because she has to be
    on the road。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They see this as maybe a difficulty in her work-life balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She's not choosing the right priorities。 And then there's a sense the way the
    story is written although it's not explicit that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe this person didn't choose tennis and it could just be that she was the
    product of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a tiger mother or gorilla father household and they drilled her and drilled
    her and drilled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: her when she was a kid， didn't have a choice， she just had to do it and then
    she just had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an aptitude for it and she got to be really good at tennis but the sense that
    she didn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: choose it herself does not appeal to some people。 They feel like she's more
    of a victim maybe than a success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So depending on which part of that story resonates with you， you might have
    picked it higher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or lower。 The final life of the six is a nonprofit executive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The nonprofit executive has got his own unique features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e337f68a8caebe71d9ef0384ff4679ec_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The first is that this person has had a successful career in finance and now
    has turned it and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has gone into a nonprofit environment where they're working for a religious
    group， a very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: strong belief system that they have。 So they're repurposing their professional
    skills toward a greater cause that appeals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to some people。 In addition， they are now turning their attention to a very
    important cause in Africa。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clean， water in villages in rural Africa and they're about to take their whole
    family over there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and lead the effort to handle this initiative and help others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That feels very appealing to some people who want to have an impact and do good
    in the， world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who choose this life at the bottom， again， focus on a different part
    of the story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They see all that but this person is taking children who， some of whom are in
    high school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: away from their social environments， they don't want to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's taken them to Africa anyway with his spouse and they feel this is just
    a time bomb。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a family about ready to explode in rural Africa and not at all something
    that you would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: define as successful。 So again， depending on your hopes， fears and fantasies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well as your experience， you， focus on different aspects of this life and
    either favor it or disfavor it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I had a very interesting experience。 I did this exercise with a group up in
    Boston and we got through all the lives and I was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: calling on people and asking them why they chose one or the other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a young lady who was in the front row had picked a nonprofit executive as
    the sixth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out of six lives and I said， "Well， what was the problem for you with this life？"，
    And she said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Very passionately。"， "Well， my mother and father were both evangelical ministers。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They dragged us everywhere they went。 They never cared about us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would never choose this life for anybody。"， And everybody is sort of taken
    with this passion that she spoke with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these lives are impossible to judge， of course， because they're very sketchily
    drawn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what you're really doing is reading your life story into each of them
    and depending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on what aspects of your life story resonate as success values， those are the
    lives that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: seem to be the ones that are appealing。 Those are the ones for others who fear
    them and don't choose them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So just for some additional perspective， first， you may not be surprised to
    know that every。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: single time I give this exercise to any group of people， 20 or more， there is
    someone in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the audience who chooses each of the lives as number one and there is someone
    in that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: audience who chooses each of those lives as number six。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this begins to help you see the point that success is not something that
    has an objective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: function。 This is something you get to choose and it's your perceptions， your
    values， your history。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your experience， your family that is going to be the foundation for your own
    vision of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what a successful life is because they all get picked and make people feel equally
    strongly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about each of them。 Just one last bit of data for what it's worth is I've given
    this online to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's available， online and thousands of people have taken it and it basically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the results online with， that many people taking it have fallen into three tranches，
    three sets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The top two lives that people pick most often are the teacher and the stonemason
    and they're， tied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not one over the other。 So people seem to value the family part， the mission
    part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the autonomy part in some way， that those two lives embody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bottom two lives that people pick and this is a big gap between the top
    and the bottom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are the wealthy investor and the banker。 I think it's interesting that both
    of those lives are the ones with the most pared down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: vision of family。 The banker has no family。 The banker has one person in their
    family but no spouse and no interest in marrying and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the wealthy investor has no children and no spouse and no interest in marrying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a defining feature of the choices people are making and family seems
    to be one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the biggest factors that people weigh when they actually give success some
    deeper thought。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then of course the non-profit executive and the tennis player both occupy
    the middle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: zone but it fascinates me that they're tied they're basically two at the top
    two in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: middle two at the bottom。 So your answers are yours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are valid and the most important thing is to try to gain some insight about
    yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from which ones you picked。 I just want to give you one last challenge that
    I give to my students at the end of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exercise and it may cause you to think about it differently or not。 That depends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But let me give you one last question。 Suppose that you died and went to heaven
    or whatever afterlife you can imagine and you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: went to check in to the everlasting life and the deity there looked on you with
    compassion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and said well you know welcome but I have one final task for you that you have
    to do before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're allowed to check in and that is this。 You need to take one of the six
    lives in the six lives exercise and you need to give it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to your only child。 So the problem you now face is which of these six lives
    would you endow to your only child。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the person you would want the best for the person that you care the most about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when I put that question to people very often as many as half of them sometimes
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little more change their vote for number one。 People who voted for the stonemason
    changed their vote to the teacher or to the wealthy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: investor or someone else。 People who voted for the wealthy investor changed
    their vote to the nonprofit executive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or someone else。 And I think the reason that people change not all do some people
    stick with the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: vote they had them at the beginning but the reason they change their vote is
    because when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're asked to give one of these lives to someone you love who has a life in
    front of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them it stops being a question of just what's your ideal or what's sort of the
    perfect picture。
  prefs: []
