- en: All right， we're back and now we're going to talk about customer retention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I hope you know where I'm going with this。 There's really two themes that
    we're going to see through all of these discussions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to begin by asking the same exact question that I asked about customer
    acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is what metric do we use to gauge and guide our retention activities？
    And so once again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's a very common metric out there。 In fact， it goes by several different
    names。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some companies call it a retention rate， some call it a churn rate or a attrition
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's just explain what it is real quickly， although you probably get the idea
    if you're not familiar with it already。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We look at all the customers we had say at the beginning of the period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We ask ourselves how many of them stayed with us。 So what percent of that original
    chunk of customers stayed with us？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the retention rate。 Of course， we can look at what percent of customers
    left。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that goes by different names， as I said， a churn rate or a nutrition rate。
    So either way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether you look at the glasses half full or half empty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's that kind of metric that firms use to say， how good a job are we doing
    at keeping our existing customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， very common metric。 And here's my view on it。 Unlike CPA， cost per
    acquisition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which I view as a very bad metric， I see the retention rate or the churn rate
    as a pretty good metric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you have to be careful about how you look at it， how you use it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how you make decisions based on it。 So I'm going to start with a real world
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things that I like to do is I like to look at the information that
    public companies put out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about their retention rates or their attrition rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What did they say about how many of their customers stick around？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what implications does it have？ How do they manage around the attrition
    rate？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of viewing it as just a nice to know number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's understand how we can actually use that information to go all the way
    to even coming up with the financial value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the entire customer base。 So here's the example that I'd like to work with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The example comes from Vodafone， a big cell phone operator。 I'm sure many of
    you are familiar with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they actually put statements out there to their investors to say， "Here's
    our attrition rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and here's how it varies over time。"， And so you can see the graphic right here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And from a very kind of quick look， it appears that there， a attrition rate
    on an annualized basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as we look at it from one quarter to another， is around 20%。 A little bit lower，
    but around 20%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's think for a second about what that means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we're losing around 20% of our customers at any given time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how long do we expect those customers to stay with us？ Pretty simple math question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me make it even simpler。 Suppose the attrition rate were 50%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because suppose we're losing half our customers every period， God forbid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then how long is the typical customer staying with us？ If our attrition rate
    is 50%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then a typical lifetime would be around two years。 So if the attrition rate
    is around 20%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the typical lifetime is around five years。 If it's a little bit less than 20%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it'll be a little bit greater than five years。 So if we want to come up with
    kind of a quick and dirty evaluation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just for a given customer， but for the entire customer base。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if our attrition rate's a little under 20%， that means a typical customer is
    with us for a little over five years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can multiply that by the amount of revenue per customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: multiply that by the size of the customer base， and boom， that's our customer
    equity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the value of the firm， at least again， as a first pass approximation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I don't want to understate that。 There's a lot of companies out there that
    are doing exactly that kind of calculation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to figure out what their customers are worth。 So here's my question。 What's
    wrong with this picture？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That sounds like a very nice calculation。 It's great to see their attrition
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what's wrong with it？ What's missing？ What is it that we really want to
    see？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I contend that it's not enough to see the attrition rate for the customer base
    as a whole。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what is it that we celebrate in the customer-centric world？ You got it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We celebrate heterogeneity。 We don't want to just see a single number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want to say what does the attrition rate look like for an average customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because there is no average customer。 We want to know how that attrition rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how that attrition propensity varies across the customers。 So here's what I
    want you to think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is a very， very important question。 How does the attrition propensity
    vary across the customers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just imagine if we can reach into the mind of each and every customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and pull out just how churn-prone or not churn-prone they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How likely they are to leave at any given time。 And we look at those numbers
    across the customer base。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What will that distribution look like？ Will we tend to have a lot of very churn-prone
    customers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Will we have a lot of customers who tend to stick around for a while？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Will it be kind of a nice bell-shaped， normal distribution？ Who knows？ Well，
    I know， and you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I think it's a very important question。 So let me show you what it looks
    like for a Vodafone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but before I do， I want to emphasize to you that the figure you're about to
    see is actually very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very typical。 This is the basic shape that we see for almost all businesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just in telecommunications， not just for a phone company that primarily
    operates in Europe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but for pretty much any company that operates on some kind of contractual subscription
    basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's what it looks like。 Here is the celebration of heterogeneity for
    Vodafone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So don't ask me where the numbers come from。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it comes through these are numbers that Vodafone calculated on their own， and
    to their credit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shared with their investors， and they broke their customer base into three groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they found that these three groups vary in terms of their churn or attrition
    rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They found that there's one real small group that has a very high attrition
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So those are people who are very， very likely to leave， you know， the next possible
    opportunity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then there's this middle-sized， middle attrition group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then there's this largest group to the left that has a fairly low attrition
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So first thing I want to ask is， is this good news or bad news for Vodafone，
    for most companies？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the answer is， yeah， it's pretty good news。 It suggests that most of their
    companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most of the customers， tend to stick around for a while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and don't have a propensity to leave right away。 Now the next question is， why
    is that？ I mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: again， it's great to know， but what is it about those customers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What words would be used to describe the customers with the fairly low attrition
    rates？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What most companies， what most managers like to use would be a word like loyal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those customers are really loyal。 They love us。 They'll run through the gates
    of hell to stay with us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe。 That's probably true for some of the customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what other words could we use to describe them？ How about words like lazy，
    inertial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: indifferent？ Maybe they just don't care very much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're not very involved with this particular product or service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're working with the service provider， and it doesn't really matter enough
    to them to decide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether to stay or whether to go。 They just don't care very much。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't know what the breakdown is here。 We have this big bar to the left。 Some
    of them are loyal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of them are lazy。 I don't know。 And for the purposes of this exercise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't necessarily care。 But I do want to emphasize that when we see all of
    those customers who tend to have a low attrition rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not necessarily a reflection of great marketing or strong branding on our
    part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although it might be， it might be that a lot of customers just don't care very
    much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's keep that in mind。 So here's my question。 Now that we're celebrating
    heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what difference does it make？ How are we going to use the information that you
    see on this chart in order to make a more informed assessment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of what the customer base is worth？ So let me make it a little bit easier for
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the graph， I'm just going to look carefully at the graph and
    pick off the various numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you see this table over here that shows you both the size of each of the
    three groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what percent of the customer base is associated with each of these three groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the attrition rate。 Okay， again， as we see， the high， medium， low risk of
    churning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's do the math right now。 In fact， take a moment and think about how you
    would take this information that's in front of you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and combine it together in order to come up with an overall value of the customer
    base。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would you do？ Think about that。 Okay， let's talk about the calculation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's what I suspect most of you did。 You probably took a weighted average。
    You said， "Look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we understand the breakdown of our customer base， 70%， 20%， 10% into the low，
    medium。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and high risk groups， and then they have their associated attrition rates。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you took a simple weighted average。 You multiplied 0。7 by 0。06， and so
    on and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on。 You did the calculation。 And as it says right here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the overall average attrition rate would be 17。7%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what does that average attrition rate tell us about the overall length of
    the customer's life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and therefore the overall financial value of the customer base？ Well， once again，
    1 over 17。7%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do that calculation。 You get 5。6 years。 Well， that sounds kind of familiar，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Isn't that just about the same number that we got when we didn't celebrate heterogeneity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what difference does it make？ Why is taking heterogeneity account going to
    help us at all here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll tell you why， because you did the wrong calculation。 You did calculate
    an overall average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but like we've said before， there is no average customer telling me that the
    average attrition rate is 17。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7% doesn't do me any good， because there is no customer out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least according to the vote of phone analysis， who has that kind of attrition
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we've just calculated an expected lifetime， an expected financial value for
    a customer who does not exist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the question is， what's wrong with this calculation？ How do we do it the
    right way？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we truly celebrate heterogeneity？ Because what we did here is we eliminated
    heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We just squashed it all together and said heterogeneity is gone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's why we ended up getting the same result that we would have gotten
    if we didn't look at heterogeneity in the first place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what's wrong with this calculation and what's the right way to do it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So think about that for a moment， and then I'll give you a super big hint from
    one of the world's leading thinkers about customer loyalty and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's turn to the words of Frederick Raikeld， who a number of years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wrote a book called The Loyalty Effect， and he laid out some many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many good ideas about what loyalty is， how we measure it， how we capture it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's a consultant for Bain， so it's not an academic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so he's really seen loyalty in action and has helped a lot of companies create
    and monetize it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's the quote from Raikeld。 You can see it here， and I hope the logic
    makes a lot of sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The average makes no sense at all。 We need to do the calculations separately，
    group by group。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that's where the celebration of heterogeneity is going to come in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's understand the separate value for the high， medium， and low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then combine them together instead of combining them together first。 I hope
    that makes sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps your inclination is to say， seems kind of similar。 You know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's take an average and then calculate the lifetime。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or let's calculate the lifetime and then take an average。 Seems kind of similar，
    but you know what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not。 So let's revisit this example， but do the lifetime calculation first。
    Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so for our low risk customers， the average attrition rate is 。06。 So what does
    that mean？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just for those customers， how long are they going to stick around on average？
    So what's 1 over 。06？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， as you can see here， it's about 16。7 years。 And if we repeat that calculation
    for the other two groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see what their expected lifetime would be。 And here you see the really
    dramatic differences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the celebration of heterogeneity。 We see an order of magnitude difference
    between the best and the worst customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want to ignore that。 We don't want to eliminate that。 We don't want
    to average over that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to celebrate that。 Once we see the expected lifetimes for each of these
    different customer groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then let's take the weighted average。 Then we'll multiply by 70， 20， and 10%。
    And when we do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do we get？ Our overall expected lifetime for this customer base， 12。4 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a big difference。 I'm sure you'll agree。 So instead of doing the calculation
    the wrong way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where we weren't celebrating heterogeneity， once we acknowledge and explicitly
    take into account heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have more than doubled the value of our customer base。 Just like that。 Not
    by doing anything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just by doing the correct calculation。 This is the celebration of heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you might be wondering， all right， so this is this Vodafone example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does this work in general？ Answer always works the same way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever there's any heterogeneity at all， any spread among the customers in
    terms of their attrition rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there will always be money left on the table if we ignore heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will always understate the value of the customer base by ignoring heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only question is how much？ So in this case it's a more than two fold increase。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as you might imagine， the magnitude of that increase depends entirely on
    the magnitude and nature of the heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if the customers are more spread out， then ignoring heterogeneity is going
    to cause us an even steeper understatement of the customer value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， it's not a question of whether it will occur。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not a question of whether it will be an overstatement or an understatement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It always works this way。 It's just a question of how much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if that's not a celebration of heterogeneity， then I don't know what is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this shows you that by explicitly accounting for heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by really understanding the differences among our good customers and our not
    so good customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have just doubled the value in our company。 Now you might wonder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so what are the implications of that for managing our customer base？ And this
    is really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really important， especially for all of you who voted for customer retention
    as the activity that we should be putting our incremental dollars on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's summarize our thinking about customer retention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's two really important points that I want to make over here。 First
    and foremost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is no average customer。 And you can't do calculations based on an average
    customer。 Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's easy。 Yes， it's convenient， but it's wrong。 You will always understate
    the value of your customer base。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that difference can be huge if you ignore the heterogeneity。 And here's
    the second point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's much more subtle， and I'll spare you the painful math to get there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if we ever want to calculate an elasticity， if we ever want to find out
    what's the incremental gain that we get for say a 1% reduction in the attrition
    rate？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out we can do that calculation two ways。 If we do it by ignoring heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as many firms do， or if we do it by taking heterogeneity into account as we
    just did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we get a very different conclusion。 So in some of my research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've actually done that calculation separately， and we show that the retention
    elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the gain that we get by lowering the attrition rate by 1% is much， much less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you account for heterogeneity。 Which means that efforts to boost retention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or decrease attrition， or churn， are much more modest than you think they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once you explicitly account for heterogeneity。 Now， I want to be really clear
    about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am not saying that you should stop spending on retention。 No， I am not saying
    that at all。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: retention is one of our three major pillars of customer centricity。 It is very，
    very important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You want to figure out who the good customers are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and do whatever it takes to keep them around for a long time。 You must do that。
    But at the margin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies seem to want to spend more and more and more on retention。
  prefs: []
