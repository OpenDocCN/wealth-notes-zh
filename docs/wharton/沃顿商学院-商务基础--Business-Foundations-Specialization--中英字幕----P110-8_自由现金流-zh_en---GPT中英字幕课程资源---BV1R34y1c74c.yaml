  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: introduced the topic discounted cash flow analysis by discussing decision， making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we talked about several different decision rules used in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between the present value of costs and the present value of benefits。 And while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most academics including me will argue that this is the best rule that you，
    should always use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lecture I want to talk about sort of the bedrock or the found one of the key。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: components of any DCF and any sort of decision making and that's free cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow specifically what is it。 So let's get started。 So remember there are two，
    components to NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are free cash flows and there's a discount rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because NPV as you recall from last time is little more than just a discounted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stream of cash flows in this case free cash flows。 So recall NPV was formally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: defined as follows and we recognize that this is really nothing new。 This is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we've been doing all along。 What I'm going to focus here is on the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: numerator the free cash flows。 How do we get at these free cash flows in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: corporate setting when whether it's capital budgeting or valuation more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: broadly how do we compute these FCFs。 That's what this lecture is really about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's let's take a look。 Free cash flow begins with revenue or sales。 We。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: subtract off costs and then we subtract off depreciation actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: depreciation and amortization but mostly depreciation by depreciation or， amortization
    both。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you might wonder well first what is depreciation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depreciation is just a countenance way of recognizing the loss in value the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deteriorate deterioration and value of physical assets like plants and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: equipment but it's sort of an accounting notion。 It doesn't represent a true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cash flow right when a plant depreciates it's not as though money is leaving
    the， company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you might wonder why we're even considering it。 Well the reason we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: considering it is because we're going to take this term in parentheses that
    I've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now bracketed and multiply it times 1 minus TC。 TC is the marginal tax rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See even though depreciation doesn't represent any dollars flowing out of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the company or away from a project it's not a literal cost in terms of， dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What it does is it does reduce our taxable income it provides a tax。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shield and so we have to take that into account when computing free cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because taxes are actual dollars leaving the company or the project。 Now this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quantity here goes by several names they're all synonyms。 Unlevered net income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: net operating profit after taxes or notepad or earnings before interest after，
    taxes EBA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once we have this we're gonna have to add back in depreciation and again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's just to net out the subtraction of depreciation here。 It doesn't represent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a true cash flow what it does represent is a tax shield so we add back in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: depreciation then we're going to subtract off you get rid of that capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expenditures or any investments we have to make and then finally we're gonna。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: subtract off the change in networking capital and that sometimes throws people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a little bit what do you mean subtract off the change in networking， capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well first what is networking capital？ Well networking capital NWC is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: equal to current yeah that that's supposed to be a U。 Current assets minus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: current liabilities and current assets that's loosely cash plus accounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: receivable plus inventory and current liabilities we're gonna focus on， accounts
    payable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now some of you might say what about short-term debt or long-term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: debt that's coming due that's financing leave that aside that's a separate issue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll talk about that a little bit in a little bit okay so what goes into the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: free cash flow calculation is not networking capital the change is important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because these are all what economists call stock variables and we're trying
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compute flows so we want to look at the change the period over period change
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: networking capital and subtract that from free cash flow。 So what what is free
    cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow intuitively well it's the residual cash flow that's left over after all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the projects requirements have been satisfied and the implications accounted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for it's the cash flow that can be distributed to the financial claimants of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the company debt and equity that's another way to view it it's not the same
    as a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: counting cash flow from the statement of cash flows but we can derive free cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow from the statement of cash flows actually with just a few steps now I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be precise here the free cash flow we we're gonna compute here or is defined。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right here this is unlevered free cash flow and I say unlevered to distinguish
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from free cash flow to equity or free or or levered free cash flow which we'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discuss on the next slide so free cash flow to equity starts with free cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow the definition of free cash flow that's just this quantity right here and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we've added well we've appended two terms we're gonna subtract off the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after-tax interest cost and add back in any net borrowing that is borrowing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: above and beyond any repayment of debt so another way to compactly write the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: free cash flow to equity is that it starts with unlevered free cash flow the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: free cash flow available to debt and equity holders and we subtract off the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after-tax interest expense and add in the net borrowing so what is free cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow to equity it's the residual cash flow leftover after all the projects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: requirements have been satisfied implications accounted for and all debt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: financing has been satisfied that's that's critical we take care of the debt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: holders for us because they're senior claimants free cash flow to equity is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the cash flow that can be distributed to the shareholders equity holders of
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: project or the company and free cash flow to equity this is look at it this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should be there we go is more precisely levered free cash flow because free
    cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow to equity is affected by the the company's choice of financial structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a leverage decision how much debt it plans to take on so let me show you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this what we've just discussed schematically in terms of a hierarchy that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's kind of getting us a little bit close to an income statement right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: remember free cash flow starts with up at the top with revenue we're gonna pull。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out the depreciation well yeah the revenue comes in we're gonna pull out the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: depreciation and costs we're gonna pull out our taxes that's gonna give us our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unlevered net income this is our no-pat or our EBA then we're gonna add back
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the depreciation because it's a non-cash expense and again that could be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: depreciation and amortization we're gonna subtract off our capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expenditures our investment requirements we're gonna subtract off our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: investment in networking capital the change in networking capital and that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gonna give us our unlevered free cash flows these are the cash flows that can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: go to debt holders and equity holders then we're gonna pull subtract out our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after-tax interest expense and I say after-tax because remember interest is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tax deductible right it provides us a tax shield and then we're gonna add back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in and in that borrowing so if the company borrows some company borrows some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company borrows some debt in excess of what it repays that's a cash inflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's available for use by the equity holders and what we're left with down
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the bottom is the levered free cash flow or the free cash flow to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: equity holders so strategic decisions a useful way to think about strategic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: versus financial decisions is that strategic decisions are gonna affect the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inputs to free cash flow well and free cash flow to equity but they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: impacting here right strategic decisions are gonna affect our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: market share and our revenue they're gonna affect our cost our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: investment decisions right investment decisions are our operations you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory and the like all of these strategic decisions are gonna impact our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unlevered free cash flow and ultimately our levered free cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: financing decisions are down here they're gonna impact our leverage choice the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the after-tax interest expense the net borrowing okay and hence that that's
    why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we refer to these cash flows here as unlevered they're unaffected by leverage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: choices now strictly speaking that's not always true in more advanced value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: valuation courses you might see financing decisions feeding back on some of
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inputs into unlevered free cash flow such as the ability of a firm to invest
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or its revenue growth but a useful benchmark and a common benchmark is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just is just to recognize that financing financing decisions do not affect the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unlevered free cash flow and that's a great way by the way to check your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: computations in any sort of valuation or DCF exercise at least one way is by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recognizing that financial policy is not going to hit the unlevered free cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e8bf77855d8ecdd50d035d37b21fec8a_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: flows all right so let's let's summarize this now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e8bf77855d8ecdd50d035d37b21fec8a_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: you know NPV is a decision rule that's going to quantify the value implications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of decisions that that's what we learned last time and it there's two key。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: components to it right there's free cash flows and discount rates this lecture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was all about how do we put some meat behind that FCF term how do we actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compute it how do we derive it for a project or a firm more more more broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: speaking and what we saw is that there's a relatively simple formula for computing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: free cash flows and don't be misled by its simplicity it applies broadly yeah
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can always use this definition the trick in practice is actually estimating
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: components and figuring out what hits unlevered free cash flow versus levered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: free cash flow what's relevant for cash flow what's not relevant for cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the remainder of this topic is going to be geared towards answering those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: questions in the context of an actual example so coming up next we're going
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: start in on forecast drivers are trying to understand how we're going to forecast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: each of those components of free cash flow out into the future thanks so much。
