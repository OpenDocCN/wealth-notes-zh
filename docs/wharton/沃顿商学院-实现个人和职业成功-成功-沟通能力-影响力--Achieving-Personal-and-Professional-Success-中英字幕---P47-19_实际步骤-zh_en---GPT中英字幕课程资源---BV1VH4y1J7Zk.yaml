- en: All right， let's think about some practical steps we can use for detecting deception
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/081d1310301175167804dc47ac7f694d_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: then figuring out what we can do once we suspect it or detect it。 So first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mentioned cognitive load。 Our cognitive load is very high when we're telling
    lies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if someone were to increase that further， I'm more likely to make mistakes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we ask somebody we suspect of deception to perform a second task while
    they're talking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/081d1310301175167804dc47ac7f694d_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: to us， that increases cognitive load。 And for many people， pushes them over
    the edge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They start making mistakes or leaking out other information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think of something like trying to remember another additional information
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another phone number or you hear other things in the background， like TV or
    talk radio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sort of going in the background or you ask many questions about different topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out when we try to remember things out of chronological order， that's
    very cognitively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: loading。 That is， it's easy for us， easiest for us in our minds， particularly
    if it's not true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to describe a story in chronological order。 If we try to get things out of order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we ask questions about things that go out of sequence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people who are lying are likely to make mistakes。 Eye contact is something that
    also increases cognitive load as our detailed follow-up questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So who else was there？ What else happened？ Was the weather like outside？ For
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that weather question， you're causing people to try to figure out what time，
    a day was it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Was there a window in that room？ Was the weather like and so on？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can do things that increase cognitive load that can push people to make
    more mistakes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly if they're lying。 Now， we can also meet in person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now meeting a person has a great advantage， not only is it more cognitively
    loading， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it allows us to assess nonverbal cues more accurately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it also can be an opportunity for a deceiver to gauge our gullibility more
    carefully as， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to be careful about just meeting in person as a blanket prescription。
    But in general。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like the idea of meeting in person。 It also makes people less likely to lie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're more concerned about lying in person， and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people become a lot less aggressive or hostile in person。 They're keyboard bullies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I spent time with people who are investigating insurance fraud。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're talking about these keyboard bullies that become Mika's lambs in person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So sometimes when people are texting or emailing or tweeting， they might say
    one thing， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then in person they behave quite differently because they find the interpersonal
    dynamics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much more anxiety provoking and they're more likely to be accommodating and
    trustworthy， in person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in general， I want to think about the environment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The environment is really important for thinking about the cognitive load to
    know who else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is listening， what's happening， who else is there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of my key prescriptions is to meet in person， but also recognize that
    we're also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: leaking information as we meet other people in person。 Another key idea is to
    search broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to be sensitive to how people act in other domains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So somebody who boasts you about how they cheat on their taxes or how they were
    deceptive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to somebody else， but not you， should be something you should be careful about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also do things like pretest with questions that we don't know answers
    to to see how forthcoming。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how honest people are behaving。 So one of the key ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to value and collect information from other sources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if it's really important information， we don't want to just trust one source。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to gather other information and recognize that deception is pretty common
    and we're not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very good in social situations at detecting it。 Now if we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so suppose you're doing something over Skype or video conference， sometimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recording interviews allow us to go back and watch things。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can go back and watch a video with the sound turned off so that now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're just focused on the nonverbal cues and we can look for things that might
    seem a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little bit off or seem a little bit weird。 There's also computer text analysis
    that people have used to do things like word counts to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: look at the use of negative statements or to look at things like a lot of irrelevant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information that can give us other cues related to deception。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's very difficult to detect in our natural communication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now suppose that we're confronting a liar， how should we do that？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the context and our relative status matters a lot。 So police， when they're interrogating
    somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will say， "I know you're lying to me，" or the， polygraph I mentioned before
    will say， "Oh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know you're lying to me。"， But we can't always have that kind of dynamic。
    In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when I was talking to insurance investigators， a lot of them were former police
    officers who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talked about the two things I missed most。 So when they were interrogating somebody
    that suspected of deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they said， "The two， things I missed most were my gun in my batch。"， And they
    said， "Yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whenever I was connecting interrogation， I'd put the two of those things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the table that created anxiety and made people much more forthcoming。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's sometimes other things we could do when we don't have that status。 We
    don't have that power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we do then？ And there， for example， you're dealing with a customer or
    a potential partner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have， to do things that are a little bit softer than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we might do things like suggest， "Hey， maybe there's more you wanted
    to say。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or I feel like there was something you wanted to add to that answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or ask a follow-up question that allows people to elaborate or ask the same
    question in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: slightly different way that gets people to repeat things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a way that suggests you're not completely comfortable with that answer， but
    without being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as confrontational。 And we can offer people or encourage people to exit the
    situation in a way that allows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them to save face so they're not likely to retaliate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because that's one risk when we confront somebody and tell them that they're
    lying to you， you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can engage reactants as they come back and they get very angry， particularly
    if there's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a loss of face。 One of my former students talked about confronting somebody
    in Korea who was lying to him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/081d1310301175167804dc47ac7f694d_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And he said this Korean manager， once he confronted him and said that he was
    lying， had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lost so much face in front of not just him but the entire group that he was
    talking to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they cut off relations completely。 So he had just meant to put things back
    on track。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it turns out he'd blown up that， relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we need to be very tactful and we need to ask sometimes softer questions
    that allow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people to come to us with a more forthcoming answer。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
