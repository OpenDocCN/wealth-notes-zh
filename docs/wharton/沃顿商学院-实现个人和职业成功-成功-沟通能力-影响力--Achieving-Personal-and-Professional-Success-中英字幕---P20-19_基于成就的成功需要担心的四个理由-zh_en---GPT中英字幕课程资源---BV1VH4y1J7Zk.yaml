- en: If you base your theory of success entirely on achievement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one is that all achievement is relative。 And we see that a lot here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wharton High School students who have been top students in their high schools
    come here for their undergraduate studies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all of a sudden they discover that they are with a sea of people who are
    all valedictorians or got perfect SATs or whatever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they suddenly don't look like they've achieved much at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of my favorite quotes that sort of sums up this problem when you apply it
    to your regular life and career。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comes from H。L。 Mecken who's an American humorist who once said that wealth
    is any income that is more than one's wife's sisters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is the great story of keeping up with the Joneses in suburban America。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you base your sort of sense of self worth on the achievement there's always
    going to be somebody who's achieved more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Has a better car， a bigger house， more money in their bank account。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: takes a better vacation or whatever it is that you're measuring by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So be careful of the theory of relativity as applied to achievement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The chances are that that's not going to be a very stable way to measure your
    successful life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second problem is that very talented people often pick the wrong pond。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what do I mean by that？ I mean your sense of success because it's relative
    is going to be measured。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're going to measure it by how you stand with respect to the people that
    you're surrounded by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you pick your pond poorly and you're surrounded by people that you think
    are outperforming you and there's no way that you can catch up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you're no longer going to feel very successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact gradually you could easily become depressed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again here at Penn that happens to some of our students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They suddenly find themselves with all these other high performing high school
    students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first semester takes place。 They don't do as well in their classes as they
    were able to do in high school because in high school they were always the top
    person and almost took no effort at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here they find themselves getting seized in their first semester courses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The self-esteem hit that they take is so powerful that they check out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They think they can't win so they stop playing。 And of course as soon as they
    stop playing they have no chances to win。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they end up going through college in a very mediocre way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They get involved in other activities but their academic performance is very
    substandard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That then affects their ability to go to grad school and other options that
    might come。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's really simple if they had picked a different pond instead of a giant
    Ivy League college and they'd picked maybe a smaller college where they'd get
    more attention where they would stand out a little more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their options for the future would be the same。 There are many many very great
    smaller institutions that students can go to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then they would feel like they were in the right pond。 A little bigger fish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little smaller pond and their confidence would remain high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their performance would be inspired and they would be motivated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So sometimes people think they don't get to choose。 The pond is the pond they
    get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I think that's absolutely wrong。 I think if you're worried about your own
    success values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you're thinking about what you really want to achieve and how your life ought
    to work and how to balance happiness and achievement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Picking your pond is a pretty important choice because you're going to feel
    more satisfaction when the pond's the right size than you are by just always chasing
    the most prestigious pond as you see it to be in and then feeling miserable once
    you're in it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's our second problem。 You've got to pick the right pond and people often
    pick the wrong one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third one is that sometimes achievers are essentially compulsive。 They only
    know how to achieve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are driven by greed to establish more wealth， pride to establish more power
    or importance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: control over others and they can never get enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So no matter every day they wake up and they are driven once again by the same
    insatiable motivations to accumulate more to have more influence and to feel better
    about themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a name for these people。 I spent some time in Asia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I studied at some Buddhist monasteries and I was taught there about a very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very sad creature in Buddhist mythology that called a hungry ghost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a hungry ghost is someone who in their lives has given way to all their
    appetites。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've been insatiable in their quest for satisfying their appetites for power，
    money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: status and admiration and so on。 And when these people die， they are reborn
    as a hungry ghost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a hungry ghost is someone， a being in the spirit world that has a body the
    size of an elephant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a huge body and a mouth the size of the head of a pin。 So throughout all of
    eternity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their endless quest is to quench this awful aching hunger because they can never
    eat enough to feel even the least bit satisfied that they've filled themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so in the Buddhism scheme of things， their reincarnation into this awful
    eternity of hunger comes from having spent their lives in the life that we're
    living。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， on an endless quest to satisfy appetites that can't be satisfied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you see any hungry ghosts in your world， that could be a boss that can't
    feel too important or it could be someone you know who's always craving more and
    more attention or someone else who is always in the throes of trying to get more
    status or more money and just can never stop and they're stepping all over the
    people around them to get there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of feeling jealous， I suggest you feel pity because these are hungry
    ghosts walking around in our own midst and life is going to come and go for them
    and they're always going to be unsatisfied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's a second trap that people can fall into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fourth reason that putting all of your success values on achievement can
    be a problem is if you wake up one day and realize that you haven't been achieving
    any goals that you set for yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you've been achieving goals that other people set for you and you weren't
    even aware of it。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/8bffe852cdbd2e7e4b2ca8f32b6c6c7b_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This can happen when someone is striving to get the approval of their family。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a father or mother who always wanted them to be a doctor and they go through
    all the trouble of going through medical school and then they wake up one day
    and they wonder why they're a doctor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't even like it very much and it turns out they're just trying to please
    a parent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be that they are in a relationship with a mentor who gives them a goal
    and they stop thinking about whether it's really the right goal for them and just
    try to please the mentor。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I was in college， I had the great good fortune to be tutored by a novelist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a guy named Anthony Burgess。 He wrote A Clockwork Orange。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which became a famous movie and was a famous British novelist。 In the course
    of our tutorial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it was just me and five other students in this semester on course， he gave me
    an assignment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He said， "You want to learn to write？ You should write some verse dramas。"，
    I went verse dramas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then he said， "You can base them on short stories。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I had to come back the next week and tell him what short stories I was going
    to write in verse as plays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very complicated assignment。 I ended up writing my senior thesis in college
    was a couple of plays that were in verse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They were based on stories by James Joyce and it was just an enormous problem。
    Here's the thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can see now that I got some value out of that exercise。 But at the time， it
    took me months。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: literally months of work to craft these things and get them into shape so that
    I could have my senior thesis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I had my senior thesis approved。 At the end of it， I felt completely empty。
    No satisfaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: no fulfillment， nothing， just exhaustion。 I think that's what happens sometimes
    when you're achieving someone else's goal and you're not really aware of the reason
    why you're doing it for yourself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have a video that I want to share with you of Steve Jobs， the founder of
    Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: co-founder of Apple computers。 It's a speech he gave at Stanford University。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a graduation speech in 2005。 In this speech， if you listen carefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're going to discover that Steve Jobs， one of the principal pieces of advice
    that he gave to the graduates and that he himself lived in his own life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was to stop achieving other people's goals and to begin to formulate and set
    on a journey to achieving ones that you yourself have set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[applause]， Thank you。 I''m honored to be with you today for your commencement
    from one of the finest universities in the world。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Truth be told， I never graduated from college， and this is the closest I've
    ever gotten to a college graduation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today， I want to tell you three stories from my life。 That's it。 No big deal。
    Just three stories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first story is about connecting the dots。 I dropped out of Reed College
    after the first six months。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really
    quit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why'd I drop out？ It started before I was born。 My biological mother was
    a young。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unwed graduate student， and she decided to put me up for adoption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his
    wife。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Except that when I popped out， they decided at the last minute that they really
    wanted a girl。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So my parents， who were on a waiting list， got a call in the middle of the night
    asking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"We''ve got an unexpected baby boy。 Do you want him？"， They said， "Of course。"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from
    college and that my father had never graduated from high school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She refused to sign the final adoption papers。 She only relented a few months
    later when my parents promised that I would go to college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was the start in my life。 And 17 years later， I did go to college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college
    tuition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After six months， I couldn't see the value in it。 I had no idea what I wanted
    to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay。 It was pretty
    scary at the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but looking back， it was one of the best decisions I ever made。 The minute I
    dropped out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping
    in on the ones that looked far more interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wasn't all romantic。 I didn't have a dorm room， so I slept on the floor in
    friends' rooms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good
    meal a week at the Hare Krishna Temple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I loved it。 And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition
    turned out to be priceless later on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me give you one example。 Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best
    calligraphy instruction in the country。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the campus， every poster， every label on every drawer was beautifully
    hand-caligraphed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces， about varying the amount of
    space between different letter combinations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about what makes great typography great。 It was beautiful， historical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture。 And I found it fascinating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life。 But ten
    years later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we were designing the first Macintosh computer， it all came back to me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we designed it all into the Mac。 It was the first computer with beautiful
    typography。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I had never dropped in on that single course in college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And since Windows just copied the Mac， it's likely that no personal computer
    would have them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Applause]， If I had never dropped out， I would have never dropped in on that
    calligraphy class。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do。
    Of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college。
    But it was very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very clear looking backwards ten years later。 Again， you can't connect the dots
    looking forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can only connect them looking backwards。 So you have to trust that the dots
    will somehow connect in your future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to trust in something， your gut， destiny， life， karma， whatever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the
    confidence to follow your heart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even when it leads you off the well-worn path。 And that will make all the difference。
    [Applause]。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My second story is about love and loss。 I was lucky。 I found what I love to
    do early in life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Was and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was twenty。 We worked hard，
    and in ten years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We just released our finest creation， the Macintosh， a year earlier， and I just
    turned thirty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I got fired。 How can you get fired from a company you started？ Well，
    as Apple grew。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And for the first year or so， things went well。 But then our visions of the
    future began to diverge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and eventually we had a falling out。 When we did， our board of directors sided
    with him。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so at thirty， I was out， and very publicly out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone， and it was devastating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I really didn't know what to do for a few months。 I felt that I had let the
    previous generation of entrepreneurs down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me。 I met with David
    Packard and Bob Nois。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly。 I was a very public failure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I even thought about running away from the valley。 But something slowly
    began to dawn on me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I still loved what I did。 The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one
    bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd been rejected， but I was still in love。 And so I decided to start over。
    I didn't see it then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could
    have ever happened to me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner
    again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: less sure about everything。 It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods
    of my life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the next five years， I started a company named Next， another company
    named Pixar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film， Toy
    Story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and is now the most successful animation studio in the world。 In a remarkable
    turn of events。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple bought Next， and I returned to Apple， and the technology we developed
    at Next is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Lorin and I have a wonderful family together。 I'm pretty sure none of this
    would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was awful tasting medicine， but I guess the patient needed it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick。 Don't lose faith。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I
    did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You've got to find what you love， and that is as true for work as it is for
    your lovers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your work is going to fill a large part of your life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the only way to do great work is to love what you do。 If you haven't found
    it yet， keep looking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and don't settle。 As with all matters of the heart， you'll know when you find
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And like any great relationship， it just gets better and better as the years
    roll on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So keep looking， don't settle。 My third story is about death。 When I was 17。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I read a quote that went something like， "If you live each day as if it was
    your last。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: someday you'll most certainly be right。"， It made an impression on me， and since
    then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the past 33 years， I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"If today were the last day of my life， would I want to do what I am about
    to do today？"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And whenever the answer has been no， for too many days in a row， I know I need
    to change something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to help me make the big choices in life。 Because almost everything， all external
    expectations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all pride， all fear of embarrassment or failure， these things just fall away
    in the face of death。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: leaving only what is truly important。 Remembering that you are going to die
    is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have something to lose。 You are already naked。 There is no reason not to
    follow your heart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: About a year ago， I was diagnosed with cancer。 I had a scan at 7。30 in the morning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas。 I didn't even know what a pancreas
    was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is doctor's code for prepare to die。 It means to try and tell your kids
    everything。
