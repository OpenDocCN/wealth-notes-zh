  prefs: []

    in this research area is we think about。
  prefs: []

    the basic ideas in this field。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you can sit between disconnected groups， you're spanning this structural
    hole。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe there's some real value in doing that。 Let's look at a picture and make
    this more plain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is， let's say， a network of six people。 Consider especially the person
    in the red dot there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what is considered a dense network。 They're all connected to each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what might be considered a disconnected network。 A larger number of
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the big feature here that differs across the two is that the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one on the left is dense and the other on the right is disconnected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What happens when you remove the red dot？ The person in the position of the
    red dot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you remove that person from the dense structure。 Everybody still talks to everybody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Information flows the same way。 Not a whole lot changes。 On the other hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the disconnected network， if you remove the person in the position of， the
    red dot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of a sudden these groups don't talk to each other at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The organization is in a very different place。 Information doesn't flow and
    something is going to function very differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clearly， a person who is in the role of the red dot will play a very different
    role in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the organization if they're in that dense structure when they're in the disconnected
    structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That gap， the gap that the red dot is spanning there in the disconnected structure
    is what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we consider a structural hole or a disconnect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a24723ebf46f6e68d3de12188cbd4521_27.png)'
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It's going to drive pretty much everything else that follows here。 A dense structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relatively few structural holes， people are highly connected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have mutual influence on each other。 This is often a cohesive， similar
    group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They work closely together， might think alike。 They probably have what the economists
    would call or the sociologists would call redundant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information。 They're often tapping a restricted set of resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrast that with the disconnected structure where there are many structural
    holes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This more often reflects a non-cohesive heterogeneous group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They provide opportunities in terms of differentiated， non-redundant information
    and they access。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a wider array of these resources。 This idea comes from research originally by
    Mark Granovett or on week ties and then really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: built out by the sociologist Ron Burt。 We want to dig into it in a little more
    detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's another picture to talk about how you might think as you grow a network
    from four。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to eight to 16 individuals， what it would look like if you did that in a very
    disconnected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way versus a very dense way。 We're going to use the terms redundant versus efficient。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: These terms， again， there's very much an economics base to the work on social
    networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It comes out of sociology， but this part of sociology is highly connected to
    economics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These guys think about utility maximization。 The actors here are highly rational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're going to very much like economics talk about costs and benefits and
    they're just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to find the optimal solution given to costs and benefits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a24723ebf46f6e68d3de12188cbd4521_33.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: They're going to use terms like redundant and efficiency。 These are modeling
    terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but let's explain to you what they mean。 The top there， it's network A， B and
    C as you move。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example， from network A where you， have four connections and network B you
    have eight connections and network C you have 16。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: connections。 In this case， every time you add someone to the network。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're adding a new relationship。 You're going from four to eight to 16 relationships。
    Great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you've got more people， but we know there are costs associated with that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is what the economists and sociologists would call redundant ties。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrast that with the three on the bottom， A prime， B prime and C prime。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This person goes from four to eight to 16 always with four relationships。 In
    each case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have perfectly efficient networks。 They're spanning these structural holes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a disconnected network and with the same four relationships， they're
    able to tap。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in to 16 people now because of the way they built it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sociologists would consider the bottom networks efficient and the top networks
    redundant because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for much less at much less costs are tapping into the same information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a24723ebf46f6e68d3de12188cbd4521_35.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The assumption here is that the resources needed to maintain relationships，
    time and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: emotion are scarce。 I think that's a very reasonable assumption。 But given that
    assumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these guys are just kind of taking it to its extreme and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a24723ebf46f6e68d3de12188cbd4521_37.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: asking， "Well， if you've got scarce resources， maybe you want to think about
    building a more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: efficient network。"， With these ideas out there， let's start talking about how
    networks might differ if you took。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them seriously， consider diversifying your network。 In this picture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we begin with what is a very dense network。 A person has five relationships
    tapping into something like 10 or 12 individuals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most of， whom are connected to other people in the same network。 And then after
    diversification。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after taking this theory really seriously， you've got the， same five relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but now it taps into a much broader， maybe 20 plus individuals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many of whom do not connect with other people。 And so you're tapping into more
    highly varied resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what the sociologists would claim are benefits of a more disconnected
    structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They would advocate even pursuing a more efficient network and eschewing redundancy
    that you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see in the denser networks。 So there are many benefits， of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people in the disconnected networks will be the first to know information
    outside of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: each pocket。 There are many benefits。 Partnerships if they want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can play rival factions against each other。 And they might be sought out
    as a broker to introduce。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make contacts， make introductions， from one part of their organization to another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many benefits。 They fall right out of it。 We don't want to ignore
    the cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you think the cost might be of this？ And we'll spend a little more time
    on that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a24723ebf46f6e68d3de12188cbd4521_39.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But I think it's fair to say that while extreme， these guys are mostly just
    making plain something。

- en: '![](img/a24723ebf46f6e68d3de12188cbd4521_41.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that many of us do intuitively。 And in fact， I would push you to reflect a little
    bit on how is it that you're deciding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where to spend your time， who to invest in， what relationships to cultivate，
    what relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to let ride。 It's something that many people want to avoid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a little bit uncomfortable to think about。 But the economic model and the
    sociological model takes us a starting place that we've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got scarce resources。 We derive utility from things like relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're essentially maximizers。 We're going to try to maximize how much utility
    we can get from our scarce resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You bring that model to relationships， and this is the kind of thing that we
    end up with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not going to say you should all think about it this way。 That you should
    act exactly like this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That you should be as efficient to network as possible。 But I like the conversation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I like having it on the table。 Not least because I think we're all doing
    something like this anyway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's put it。 Let's be a little bit more explicit about it。 Let's talk about
    the trade-offs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then let's see how we can exercise these ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How we can use these tools in a way that isn't offensive to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want to act in a way that isn't in the spirit of how we want to live。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want to act in a way because the sociologist tells us this is more
    efficient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just for that reason。 But can we borrow those ideas？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can we borrow those tools and do it in a way that actually fits with the way
    we want to， live？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's where we're coming from。 So a little more motivation for considering
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's work here by Ron Burt。 This was empirical work。 So far we've just talked
    theory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Burt went out and ran a big study in a large organization that looked at how
    employees rose。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through the ranks there。 What rate of promotion they got over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And he compared that to the networks they had when they began。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What he found was strong relationship。 Social science goes this is a very strong
    relationship between those who had many disconnects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when a relatively disconnected structure compared to those who had few disconnects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and more dense and formal structure。 Those with more disconnects showed a higher
    rate of promotion in the organization over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a24723ebf46f6e68d3de12188cbd4521_45.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So this was kind of the beginning of what has turned into a huge industry and
    academic work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on what are the empirical consequences of these various network structures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a little bit of motivation for well maybe it's not more than just theory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe these are things that do make a difference。 This idea that by tapping
    into a more diverse network we get information and opportunities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we wouldn't if we tapped into a more homogenous， more dense， more dense
    network。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So are there limitations？ Of course there are limitations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've named a few but we always want to mind these limitations and we want to
    in other parts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the course we unpack them more explicitly。 But if you think about， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to maximize the efficiency of my organization， my network， what's
    the risk here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're sitting there on the right hand side with four relationships into
    16 people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's the risk？ Obviously one of the biggest risk is what happens if that one
    contact that you have in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a cluster of four goes away？ What happens if that person moves or something
    goes wrong in that relationship？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then your only bridge into that group is gone。 So this is fine with the sociologists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They'll just say， look， we can still deal with that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have an especially important cluster of people then you need to have
    more than one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relationship in there。 You need some redundancy just in case something goes
    wrong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can drop that right into their model， run the utility maximizing thing
    again and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's going to give that kind of answer。 The more important the group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more important that you have some redundant ties into it。

- en: Let me give you one small example from politics in the United States that ends
    with a quote。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that I love that captures this pretty well。 "Jim Wright was a longtime congressman
    from the Dallas Fort Worth area in Texas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was in Congress for 34 years and finally near the end of his career there
    he took over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a speaker of the house。 He seceded Tip O'Neill who was a longtime and famous
    speaker of the house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Jim Wright goes in and he only the last two years and this poor guy was in
    Congress。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for 34 years and he gets indicted as Speaker of the House and has to resign。
    Why did that happen？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was the beginning of Newt Gingrich。 Gingrich took it on himself to run
    right out basically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He wanted more power。 He wanted to undermine the Democratic Party and so he
    found ways to run him out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gingrich， there's a lot of detail on this and that doesn't matter as much for
    the moment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
