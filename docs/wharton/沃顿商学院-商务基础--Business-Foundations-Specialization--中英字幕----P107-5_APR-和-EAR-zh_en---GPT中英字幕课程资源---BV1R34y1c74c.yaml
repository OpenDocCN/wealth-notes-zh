  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    banks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking at these rates is when you're when you're looking at these savings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and these numbers 2。37。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2。4， they're different。 So that begs the question is， why are they different？
    How are they related？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And most importantly which one， is going to tell me how much money I'm going
    to make when I invest in this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product。 Well let's go through this starting with the rate。 The rate refers
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the APR the annual percentage rate。 That measures the amount of simple interest，
    earned in a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simple interest is just the interest earned without， compounding， ignoring compounding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you're wondering what compounding is， we're going to talk about it but
    just as a preview notice underneath the rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have compounded daily。 Simple interest ignores that compounding frequency。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many banks quote interest rates in terms of an APR。 The problem is the APR is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: typically not what we're going to earn or what we're going to pay。 For that
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have to turn to the APY or the annual percentage yield which is really just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another way of saying EAR or effective annual rate。 See the EAR that measures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the actual amount of interest earned or paid in a year。 That's what we care，
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The EAR that's the number we care about。 The rate or the rate or the APR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/06d8c6b653854e40fbdc2d13a1b26c2c_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that's just a quoting convention。 Now how are these different rates related？
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before showing you the explicit mathematics which frankly are almost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trivial let me emphasize the following。 The EAR is a discount rate。 The EAR
    is what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: matters for computing interest and discounting cash flows。 The APR is not a，
    discount rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a means to an end。 It's a quoting convention。 We're going to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APR in conjunction with compounding frequency information to get at an EAR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or at a periodic discount rate which I'll introduce in just a moment。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: remember EAR equals discount rate。 APR equals quote。 Now how do we get from
    one， to the other？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we move from APR to EAR or vice versa？ Well here's that simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mathematical formula I referred to just a moment ago。 The EAR is related to
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APR by this equality。 Well what's going on here？ K that's just the number of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compounding periods per year。 So imagine we had monthly compounding。 That would，
    imply K of 12。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How about semi-annual？ That would imply K of 2。 And I'm going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: introduce a little bit of notation here。 I is the periodic interest rate or
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: periodic discount rate and that equals APR over K。 Let's do an example。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imagine we're investing $100 in a CD offering 5% APR with semi-annual， compounding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much money will we have in one year？ Well there's actually two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways to approach this problem and we're going to do each in term。 The first
    thing， we do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first thing we always do is we draw a timeline and so today period zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to invest $100 and the question is asking how much money are we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to have in one year？ Now I've left this as a question mark to emphasize
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fact that there are two ways to go about this。 Let's go about this the first
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go about answering this problem。 The first is to work in periods。 With semi-annual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compounding that means there are two periods per year since I'm interested in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much money I have after one year that's after two periods。 And these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: periods are every six months period one， period two。 So if I'm going to work
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: periods I better compute a periodic discount rate。 That's I which we know is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APR over K in which in this case reduces to 2。5%。 In other words I'm going to
    earn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two and a half percent over the first six months and I'm going to earn two and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a half percent over the next six months。 So I take my initial $100。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: investment I multiply it by my periodic discount rate and after one period I've，
    got $102。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 50 then I repeat I take that $102。50 I multiply it by my periodic， discount
    rate to get $105。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 00 and a little over 6 cents。 In other words the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: value two periods hence of $100 in this setting is just 100 times 1 plus I，
    raised to the power 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're working in periods so I is our discount rate and 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the number of periods we're moving the money forward in time。 Now let's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: approach the problem from the perspective of years。 Now we're looking for how
    much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: money we have after one year but if we're going to work in years okay now we
    need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be consistent so after six months this isn't one period this is half a year
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because we're working in years our discount rate isn't going to be the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: periodic interest rate I it's going to be the ER the equivalent or the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: effective annual rate excuse me which we know from earlier is just one plus
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: periodic rate raised to the number of compounding periods per year so one plus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I to the K which in this setting comes out to 5。0625 percent。 In other words
    over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this entire period I'm going to earn 5。0625 percent which turns out to equal，
    $105。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 06 a little over 6 cents that is the future value one period one year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: excuse me one year from now of a hundred dollars is a hundred dollars times
    one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: plus the EAR raised to the power one we're working in years which gives me the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exact same answer we got before the one hundred five dollars and six then a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quarter cents so the lesson if you discount cash flows using the EAR then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you better measure time in years if you discount cash flows using the periodic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest rate then you better measure time in periods and the equality between
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two that we just showed with our simple example is much more general and given。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by this straightforward proof which I'm not going to discuss in detail but I'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: show you there if you're interested in looking at it so just to summarize we
    can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work in periods right one two with a periodic interest rate or we can work in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: years with our effective annual rate and notice I measure everything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consistently periods versus years so let's go back to our original example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/06d8c6b653854e40fbdc2d13a1b26c2c_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: excuse me we had an APR of 2。37 percent we have a compounding frequency daily。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which I'm going to assume 365 days though you should be aware it could be 360
    days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or it could be 252 business days it depends upon the convention used for that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product by that institution so this these two pieces of information the APR
    and K。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: allow me to compute the periodic rate I which is 0。006741 percent now that's
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tiny number but we're computing interest every single day here which means the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: effective annual rate which equals 1 plus i to the K or which in this case is
    1， plus 0。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 006714 percent raised to 365th power gets me to just under 2。4 percent， so when
    we round the 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 398 we get about 2。4 percent。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
