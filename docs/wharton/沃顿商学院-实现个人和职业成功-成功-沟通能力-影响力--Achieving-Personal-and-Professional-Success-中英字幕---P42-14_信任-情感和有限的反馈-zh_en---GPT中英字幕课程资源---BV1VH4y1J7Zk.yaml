- en: There are two additional topics I want to think of with respect to trust。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: One is emotion and the second is feedback。 Now let me think about emotion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose I ask you how do you feel？ It turns out our feelings are pretty complicated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often when we're making judgments we use our feelings as a summary statistic
    that integrates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of different dimensions。 So if I were to ask you how do you feel about
    this candidate we're trying to integrate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across a lot of different things。 How competent are they？ How much do we need
    their skill set？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Would they get along with the people here？ We're trying to integrate across
    a lot of different dimensions and we often summarize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this with how do I feel about this。 Or think about going out and you look at
    20 different homes and you try to figure out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which home you want to buy。 How do you feel about this？ Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's this summary statistic that integrates a lot of information and the trust
    decision is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot like this。 Do I trust this person is often predicated on a feeling？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do I feel like I can trust this person？ We talk that way and it's absolutely
    how we behave as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my own research I've actually looked at the link between emotions and trust
    and one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thing I found that's particularly interesting is how our feelings can influence
    our trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea here is that sometimes our feelings are really relevant so you betrayed
    me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm upset and so I don't trust you。 It's a directed emotion that makes a lot
    of sense for influencing trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's interesting is that our incidental emotions， emotions that are unrelated
    to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: situation at hand also matter。 By incidental what I mean is suppose you get
    a parking ticket or suppose you get into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an argument with your spouse and then you come into work and you deal with somebody
    who's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: totally unrelated to that other experience。 The question is does that emotion
    bleed into your new interaction？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the answer is yes。 So how we feel in the moment is influenced not just by
    what's happening in this exact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moment but it's also influenced by what's happened before。 And so these incidental
    emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these unrelated emotions from some other experience can influence， our judgments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's the idea。 If we're angry about something else and that bleeds into
    our judgment it'll make us less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trusting。 If we're happy about something else， so we just found some great news
    unrelated to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meeting that I'm currently having that happiness can bleed in and boost my trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm maybe too trusting when I'm otherwise very happy and I'm maybe not trusting
    enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when I'm a little bit angry from something else。 I've documented this in my
    own research and the implication is that we should be careful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to recognize that our trust judgments can move。 They're relatively labile particularly
    for people we don't know well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a new partner or a prospective client， we're making these trust judgments
    on the fly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a constructed judgment。 Our insulin emotions don't really matter very much
    for people you know well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how much you trust your mom isn't going to be influenced by how you're feeling
    unless。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're feeling pretty strongly about something。 Now when it's not just our own
    judgments I'm worried about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also worry about how much other people are likely to trust us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when you go to the boss or you're meeting a new partner if they're upset
    about something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: else and it could be almost anything。 Their favorite sports team lost a political
    outcome and argument they have with their spouse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they're upset about something you should recognize that those feelings may
    well bleed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into their assessments of you and you want to make sure that either you let
    time pass。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and come back at different time。 That's the first best option。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well the second best option is to make sure they're making the correct attribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might say oh I know you're pretty upset about that other outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm hoping that doesn't influence this situation。 By explicitly acknowledging
    and recognizing something that does mitigate the influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of that incidental emotion on the current judgment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay now those are judgments that can influence our trust but in whom should
    we place our trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what do emotions have to say about that。 And here I'm going to switch to
    a very different kind of emotion and I'm going to talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: guilt。 It turns out that when we're assessing in whom to place our trust the
    people we should。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really trust are the guilt prone people。 And by guilt prone I mean people who
    are likely to feel guilty should they fall short。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's an example of how to assess that。 Imagine you ask someone and it could
    be a prospective employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You ask them something like the following。 Describe a time when you made a mistake
    at work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How did you feel when this occurred？ What did you do？ What did you learn from
    this experience？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you listen to those responses what you're listening to are answers to these
    questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how likely is person to feel badly if they did something wrong even if nobody
    knew about， it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Does this person have a strong sense of responsibility for others？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And will this person feel bad about letting others down？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now those are all guilt-prone-ness questions。 So would they feel guilty if they
    did something bad even if nobody knew about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out the guilt prone people are exactly the same people we should trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those are the most trustworthy people around。 People who are low in guilt proneists
    we should be careful about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who are high in guilt proneists are people we should trust the most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last idea I want to suggest has to do with limited feedback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we're trusting other people we often face a challenge because we can't
    monitor them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the time。 Sometimes we can check in and see what they're doing。 Sometimes
    we can't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the key idea here is we want to think about how anticipated that monitoring
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So can we observe occasions when they don't expect to be monitored？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or is it the case that they always know when we're coming？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They always have time to prepare or they always know when they're going to be
    observed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out people act pretty strategically。 So they know that when they're
    being evaluated they step up and they behave in an exemplary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way。 We also know when people know that they're not going to be observed when
    things aren't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9b8506b5fbbfb3f8492b4da8900f9bd7_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: going to be important that they slack off。 Now again the high guilt prone people
    are going to be pretty good even in those cases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But people who are low in guilt proneists are likely to behave very strategically
    demonstrating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exemplar behavior when they're observed and then slacking off when they're not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now here's the problem。 When we observe behavior and I've run a number of studies
    looking at this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we observe， behavior the people who are observing others put too much weight
    in that observed period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's like the boss who comes back from vacation and sees the office staff
    working really， hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then goes back on vacation and then when they return again sees the office staff
    working。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really hard。 And the more observations the boss has the more and more convinced
    the boss becomes these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are really hard workers。 That is they're relying solely on what they can see
    and they're failing to imagine what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: happens when they're not around。 So we want to be careful about making inferences
    from limited feedback when the feedback that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we get is constrained and it's anticipated。 We want to make sure that we account
    for how strategic other people often act。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how particularly， often act and recognize that the limited observations we have
    can actually send us off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the wrong course we might actually build very high trust in sometimes very
    strategic， people。
  prefs: []
