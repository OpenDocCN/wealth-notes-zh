# 沃顿商学院《实现个人和职业成功（成功、沟通能力、影响力）｜Achieving Personal and Professional Success》中英字幕 - P18：17_成功的科学.zh_en - GPT中英字幕课程资源 - BV1VH4y1J7Zk

Welcome back to my office。 It's great to see you。 And I'm very interested and eager to talk to you about a really important subject that is going to allow us to look at what some of the research tells us about these two buckets of success。

the inner life， the outer life， the outer life， focused on achievement， the inner life。

focused on happiness。

I'm a lawyer， so I'm not a social scientist。 I'm a person who has read deeply a philosophy in psychology。

had the privilege of working in an environment that has steeped in social psychology and social science。

And one of the benefits of being at a place like the University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School is that a tremendous amount of research is done on a lot of the topics that are relevant to the study of success。

Most notably， here at Penn， we have the Positive Psychology Center led by Marty Seligman。

Angela Duckworth， and others who've studied happiness for over a decade。

And I attend their seminars， have the benefit of learning from them about all the different findings that they have come up with。

And then， of course， here at Wharton， quite a number of people study the science of achievement。

And so I've been very privileged to work with Adam Grant。

who's one of our top management professors and his research on giving and originality and creativity。

So while I'm not a scientist， I do have some familiarity with the science of success。

and I want to try to share that with you both because it's interesting， but most importantly。

because it will help you understand better what's really underneath the lid of these two boxes。

the happiness box， the achievement box， and begin seeing how it works and how it sort of better ways to think about these two subjects。

So in my work over the last 10 years studying and teaching about success。

one of the most interesting discoveries that I've made is that a great number of the traditional "How to Succeed" books。

although they weren't based on science， turn out to be validated by modern social science。

In America， I've been， you know， culture preoccupied with success。

The first magazine called Success magazine was published in the late 1800s。

and there are all kinds of people who've written wonderful books in the 20s and 30s that are still sold today。

A couple of them "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie， written in the 1930s。

really underlies the sort of importance of self-esteem to people。

and how to create friendships and mostly friendships of utility， working relationships。

but very effective at communicating how to do that。

Another classic book in the success literature is a book by a guy named Napoleon Hill called "Think and Grow Rich。

" a very provocative title。 But what it's really about is visualization。

believing in yourself what has come to be called mind power as a theory of success。

It turns out that modern cognitive psychology， work of people like Carol Twach。

who's a psychologist at Stanford， has shown that believing in yourself in a certain way。

she calls it the growth mindset。 Absolutely a reliable social science finding about how to amplify your success in life。

And most sports psychology these days， if you look at an Olympics where the athletes are getting ready to go down a hill to go on a slalom for skiing。

you'll watch them。 They'll be at the top of the hill。 They'll have their eyes closed。

They'll be weaving back and forth。 And they're going through the course in their mind。

imagining each turn。 And that's exactly what Napoleon Hill was talking about when he talked about using the mind and the power of the mind to visualize the future for yourself。

So it's an interesting fact that the basic "How to Succeed" books turn out to be much more right than you would have expected。
