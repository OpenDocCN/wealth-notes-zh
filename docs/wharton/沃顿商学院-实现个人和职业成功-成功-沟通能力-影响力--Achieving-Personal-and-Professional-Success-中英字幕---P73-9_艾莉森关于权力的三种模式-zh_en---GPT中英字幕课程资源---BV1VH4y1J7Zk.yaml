- en: '"Conceptual Models and the Cuban Missile Crisis。"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: His motivation was to suggest that there were multiple ways we could understand
    why countries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do what they do。 And yet， political science had only focused on one of those
    ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So he used the Cuban Missile Crisis as a case study to better understand， to
    illuminate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: three different models you could bring to explaining international behavior，
    governmental， behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the three models， we'll go to each of these in more details， but the three
    models were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: model one， the rational analysis， model two， organizational process， and model
    three， bureaucratic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: politics。 So， model one， rational policy， rational analysis。 In this model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the national government is a unitary actor。 So there's no dispersion of interest
    underneath it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just a solitary actor。 You can think of it as a person， essentially， a
    single solitary actor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then that actor is rational。 This is a critical bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no room for biases or misunderstanding of lack of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a rational decision maker。 And each action you observe then is part
    of a strategic objective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: according to some plan， to accomplish the goal。 And this has been the default
    way of analyzing governmental behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the Cuba case， how might that explain what we observed？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So consider the options that the US had in responding to discovering these missiles
    in， Cuba。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They could do nothing。 That wasn't going to happen。 They could use diplomacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which was one option that was definitely debated。 They could approach Cuba secretly
    to see if they could work out a deal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They could use the blockade， which is ultimately what they decided。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They could have used surgical airstrikes， which was probably the single most
    heavily considered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: alternative to the blockade。 Or they could do a full-scale invasion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does the rational model say about what we observe？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it suggests that it was the rational choice to do the blockade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was best because it was the middle course of action， not as extreme as either
    diplomacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or military intervention。 It put the onus back on Khrushchev。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the Kennedy administration felt the burden of choice here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they might have wanted to return it back to Khrushchev and find out what
    he wanted， to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then it limits the engagement。 This was a critical part of the debate there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that it's not as big a commitment， obviously， as involving your military。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a little bit of an engagement， enough of an engagement to so that
    they're serious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but not a full-scale engagement。 And then finally and importantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it showed that the US has a military advantage， especially， in this part of
    the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So on conventional military arms at this time， the US had an advantage， and
    it would demonstrate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that and that would be an important signal to the Soviet Union as they decided
    how they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wanted to respond。 So there are all these rational reasons and there's a single
    interest that the government。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wanted to accomplish， and that would help us explain what happened。 But that's
    only one way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another model， this is where Allison really starts digging in， is what he called
    organizational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: process。 And in this model， the government is not a unitary actor。 It's a semi-futile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: loosely-aligned organization。 So you can think of it as， you know， you've got
    different departments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you've got different， interests， you've got different groups trained in different
    ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they may not all have， the same way of thinking about things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They may not even have all the same interests。 In this model， the governmental
    actions are outputs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're not a choice an organization makes。 It's just an output of a routine
    as they went about their business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interestingly， few problems in organizations， especially governments， are strictly
    the domain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a single part of the organization。 They're factored。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They get divided into split-across organizations。 And this can lead to difficulty
    in coordination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least to factionalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/333dd088b2e2fe2bd142037670bb6b3b_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And it emphasizes that this isn't in fact a choice the organization's making
    as much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as just the outcome of these factionalized parts of the organization going about
    their， business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a great quote Allison has in this article。 He says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"The best explanation of an organization''s behavior at T is T minus one。"，
    What he means by that is。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you want to understand why an organization did what they did today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just look at what they did yesterday。 There's so much inertia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's so much routine in an organization that a lot of what we observe at
    any given。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moment is just a product of what they've been doing。 So how does this explain
    Cuba？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What organizational routines influence the outcome here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one set of routines were around intelligence gathering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there were bits of information that were collected by various intelligence
    agencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lumber ships rode very high in the water。 That was odd because lumber ships
    should be full of lumber and therefore they should。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be low in the water。 There was a Cuban and a bar ranting about what was going
    on down there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was a view at one point of a missile profile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But these were in different parts of the organization。 There was no routine
    for aggregating those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they never rose up into some conclusion。 This anticipates some of the
    critique of the intelligence community at 9/11 as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The routines just weren't built for aggregating into a solitary organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/333dd088b2e2fe2bd142037670bb6b3b_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There was a delay in scheduling surveillance flights due to interagency conflict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The intelligence agencies wanted to fly the planes but the military organizations
    wanted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to fly the planes。 And until they could get that settled they didn't fly the
    planes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they gathered intelligence more slowly than they would have otherwise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then in one of the most profound examples the configuration of the Soviet
    missile bases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: made a difference here。 So here's a map and this actually comes from the lower
    level reconnaissance flights that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: took place later in the crisis。 But you can see the installation here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is a close up version of what they observed on the first day of the
    crisis when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they thought there might be missile installations in Cuba。 How did they know
    that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They knew that because each of the elements of this missile site， the tanks，
    the trucks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the tents that cover the missile materials are laid out in the exact same way
    in Cuba as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are at every other Soviet missile site in the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there is a routine the Soviet military had for setting up missile sites。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The commander that is in charge here locally gets there。 His materials arrive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He opens up the Soviet handbook for how to set up a missile site and he starts
    following， the plan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That routine made it trivial really for the U。S。 to diagnose when they saw this
    picture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that this was a Soviet missile site。 Purely the product of organizational process。
    Other examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So analysis， at one point the U。S。 considered these mobile missiles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They classified them as mobile missiles。 And that changed the way the administration
    thought about how they should respond because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they thought if they're mobile they're going to move as we deploy surgical strikes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it turned out that was merely a semantics essentially that even though it
    was called。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mobile it wasn't so mobile that the strikes wouldn't have worked and yet it
    affected the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decision making at the most important moment the decision making of the U。S。
    government。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The processes around implementing the blockade。 So for example in a moment that's
    caught in the movie 13 days which is a fantastic movie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about this whole thing。 The naval blockade， there's a certain way naval blockades
    are set up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've been done the same way for essentially centuries and yet the kid of
    the administration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wanted to set them up differently。 The kid of the administration wanted to set
    them up closer to the country to give the Soviet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more the Soviets more time。 They wanted more distance between the ships and
    the blockade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They wanted to give the Soviets more chance to turn around essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was a major point in contention with the Navy because as they said we've
    been setting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up blockades since the days of John Paul Jones and they were reluctant to do
    it differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even though it was fundamental to how the U。S。 navigated this crisis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then finally there were all these routinized activities that sent kind of
    false signals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about what was going on。 We mentioned the U2 flight over Russia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also there was a nuclear test often in the Pacific theater that was again completely
    unrelated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to what was going on between the U。S。 and Soviets and Cuba。 But how would the
    Soviets know that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As one person said in fact this was Kennedy。 There's always one son of a bitch
    who doesn't get the message。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just routines just organizational processes but dangerously provoking the situation
    as， a result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third model that Allison suggests is bureaucratic politics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in this model policy is the outcome of bargaining games。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Heath in this model thinks about organizations as participants， players with
    different positions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest， ambitions and where you are。 What position you're in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what placement the organization influences your decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the outcome rather than a solitary actor making a single rational decision
    is just this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: output of all these different negotiations。 So a quote he has here that captures
    it well is where you stand depends on where you sit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This I hope begins to demonstrate to you the connection between this military
    governmental。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: situation and your organization because we think things like this greatly apply
    to most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organizations where you stand depends on where you sit。 So some examples here
    from this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What were the interest and abilities of the key players here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This whole event carried extra weight for Kennedy because he was mid term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was a couple just a little bit more， two years away from election， a year
    away from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the campaign beginning。 He had been seen as weak among his critics on military
    matters and so he faced this extra。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: risk of anything on the diplomatic side of things because of the political consequences。
    Moreover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Bay of Pigs still loomed large for them。 This was a complete fiasco in his
    first year in office and that meant that there was extra。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: weight on this crisis as well。 And then there were key alliances within the
    organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So probably the most important was between Kennedy and his brother Robert， the
    attorney， general。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What if Robert Kennedy had been in favor of bombing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Would that have made a bigger difference than the advocates that did exist were
    typically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: military guys。 The president Kennedy was closer to his brother than the military
    leaders so the fact that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Robert Kennedy was inclined that way probably made a difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What if McNamara hadn't been reluctant to employ the military？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: McNamara was the secretary of defense and again somebody that had a lot of influence
    over， Kennedy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: McNamara was slow。 He was reluctant to engage the military in the way that the
    actual military leaders wanted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them engaged。 So it seems like in this situation the individuals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the dispositions of the individuals and the alliances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they had made a very big difference in what happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when you approach problems with a model three mindset you not only navigate
    the politics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of your own organization but it helps you understand the politics of the other
    organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps， the organization that you're negotiating with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this led to Kennedy responding to the first of Christchoff's messages， not
    the second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of Christchoff messages。 There are tapes of the conversations of the ex-com
    meetings where advisors are trying to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're advocating different views of what's going on in the Soviet Union and
    they're trying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to understand how can you reconcile the first message with the second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And some of them come to believe， "Well， we think Christchoff is in this position。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He has these interests。 He has these constraints and the best way to get to
    him is to ignore the second letter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: appeal to the first and that kind of reasoning helped Kennedy offer the exchange
    and ultimately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: encourage persuade Christchoff to pull missiles out of there。"， So to recap。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allison's models of organizational politics which we're talking about here in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: governmental situations because we think they're relevant in a non-governmental
    model one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rational analysis， this model explains an outcome as the optimal response for
    the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as a whole to a specific set of conditions and objectives very rational and
    this has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: been the traditional way of thinking about organizations。 Model two， organizational
    process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This model explains an outcome as the result of systemic pressures and routinized
    behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to applying this framework is to think of an outcome as being the byproduct
    of activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the byproduct of activities and imperatives not specifically intended to produce
    that outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then model three， bureaucratic politics。 The model explains outcomes as
    a product of the accumulated preferences and strategies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of people or sub-organizations。 Sometimes negotiations are between parts of
    the organization making up an organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's a quick summary。 You could think about the logic of these models being
    rational in model one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: routine in model， two and bargaining， rational routine or bargaining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think about the locus of them bearing as well。 Model one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the locus is the organization as a whole。 Model two is more the division or
    function and then model three is more the individual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can also think about what they manifest。 Model one manifests choice
    of the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model two is more an output， more byproduct and model three is more an outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these individual bargains， negotiations going on bubble up to an outcome
    for the organization。
