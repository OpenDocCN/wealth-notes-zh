- en: discounted cash flow analysis。 But before doing so， I want to briefly recap
    our， last topic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest rates。 We started off discussing interest rate quotes and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how they differed from the interest rates we use to discount cash flows。 We。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then discussed how to discount cash flow streams when the cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: arrived at frequencies other than annual and when the compounding of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest was something other than annual as well。 We closed off the topic by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discussing the term structure of interest rates and the yield curve both of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today we turn to discounted cash flow analysis and I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to start the topic off by discussing how firms or people more generally should
    be， making decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's get started。 Hey everybody， welcome back to Corporate， Finance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today we're going to be shifting gears to a new topic， discounted cash， flow
    analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But before doing so， I want to briefly recap our last topic， interest rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in that topic we started off by introducing the notion of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APR and EAR and a periodic discount rate。 The difference being as follows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APR is our annual percentage rate or a means to quote interest rates。 Whereas，
    EAR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: effective annual rate and the periodic interest rate are actually， discount
    rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're economically relevant。 They're what we care about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're what we use to discount cash flows and make decisions。 Then we use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those discount rates to value and assess cash flow streams that were no longer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: arriving on an annual basis and to deal with the compounding of interest on
    a， non-annual basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we closed off the topic with a discussion of the term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: structure of interest rates which is the relation between the interest rate
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the term of the investment or the duration of the investment。 And we discussed，
    yield curves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: loosely how to construct them， what the yield means， where it comes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from and how to interpret these graphs。 Now we're going to switch over to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discounted cash flow analysis and I want to start by motivating the topic and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: providing a little bit of background by discussing decision making。 So let's
    get， started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with a question。 How should we make financial decisions？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well a reasonable answer might be to undertake those actions that create value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: value for those affected by the decision， value for the owners of a firm for
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But which actions create value？ And well that's a complicated question， a sort
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: general answer that seems reasonable would be to consider actions in which the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: benefits exceed the costs。 But here's a little wrinkle。 What if the costs and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: benefits arrive at different times？ Well actually we're well equipped to deal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with that wrinkle because we can compare the present value of the benefits to
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: present value of the costs。 See because by computing the present value we know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that the discount rate R will adjust both for the timing and the risk of the，
    cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that brings us to our first lesson which is that the NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decision rule that is NPV which stands for net present value NPV。 The NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decision rule says that we should accept all projects with a positive NPV and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reject all projects with a negative NPV where NPV is nothing more than the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: difference between the present value of the benefits and the present value of，
    the costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words if the present value of the benefits is big is bigger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than the present value of the costs that's a good thing that creates value and
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to undertake that project or make that decision that leads to positive
    NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And while this formula right here looks somewhat vague and ambiguous it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually masking something that we're already very familiar with and that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just discounted cash flows。 NPV is nothing more than discounted cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: except now instead of cash flow CF I have this F in front of all the cash flows。
    So， it's F CF。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The F simply stands for free。 So these are free cash flows but they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: still just cash flows nonetheless。 There's nothing special there。 I'm going
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: formally define and discuss how to compute free cash flows in our next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lecture but for the time being just recognize we're doing nothing new here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're simply taking a stream of cash flows FCF not FCF one through FCF T and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're discounting them back to today by a discount rate R to get a present value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a net present value。 That's it。 And so the decision rule just says if the NPV
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: greater than zero except the project if the NPV is less than zero reject the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: project sorry reject the project and while that seems fairly easy and straightforward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually implementing it is quite a bit more subtle and we're going to talk
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those subtleties as we move along throughout this topic。 So before moving on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to some of the mechanics of a DCF analysis I want to talk about decision。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what people in different areas of both finance and non-financial sectors are。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: internal rate of return as the most popular decision criteria that CFOs use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's followed somewhat closely by the payback rule and to a lesser extent
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discounted payback rule and in our in our discussion of DCF well NPV is going
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be center stage we're actually going to spend a fair amount of time discussing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of these decision rules because each one actually has important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information for the decision-making process though each one also has certain。

    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: investment bankers are also relying on discounted cash flow analysis you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something akin to NPV but they're also using a host of comparables methods or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relying on multiples and while this is going to take us a little bit outside
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the scope of our course I might mention if we have some time how we use multiples。
