- en: '![](img/c9013ce26e989f6eabf3dee2d15b7cbc_18.png)'
  prefs: []

    business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

    than we see in the income statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you， have to dig into a different part of the report to find it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's take a look at the balance sheet， which is on page 48 of the 3M10K。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c9013ce26e989f6eabf3dee2d15b7cbc_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And again， we will compare it to our relic spotter balance sheet。 So this is
    as of December 31st。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the point in time。 Always start with cash。 That's the most liquid asset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3M also has marketable securities， which are very liquid。 So things like securities
    that deposit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Council receivable comes next on both statements。 3M talks about allowances。
    In a couple weeks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll talk about what these allowances for Council receivable mean。 Then we
    had inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also see inventories for 3M。 As a manufacturing company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have different categories of inventory。 We'll talk about that in about
    three weeks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We had things like prepaid interest receivable， notes receivable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3M just lumps those into other current assets。 Then for non-current assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we had land building metal detectors， accumulated depreciation PPE。 We look
    at 3M。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have their PPE at cost in one line， less accumulated depreciation to get
    the net。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's the same treatment of original cost minus total depreciation gives you
    net that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we saw with relic spotter。 Just with relic spotter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we got a little bit more detail on the makeup of the PPE。 And then for intangible
    assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we just had software。 3M has a lot more goodwill， intangible assets nets， prepaid
    pensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the always popular， other assets。 In terms of liabilities， we had accounts
    payable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest payable， income taxes payable， under， earned revenue， for relic spotter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can find similar things for 3M。 Counts payable， accrued payroll， accrued
    income taxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Accrued income taxes is another way of saying income tax is payable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a crude means the same thing has payable。 They have other current liabilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which presumably will have some of these other liabilities， in there。 We had
    one long-term debt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mortgage payable。 Here 3M has their long-term debt。 As I talked about in the
    prior video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can also put the current portion of that in current， liabilities as 3M does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gets us down to total liabilities for 3M after there's a couple other liabilities
    that we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: didn't have for relic spotter。 And then finally， for shareholders' equity， we
    had common stock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APIC， and retained earnings。 So 3M common stock， notice it's a really small
    balance because their par value is really small。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: basically only one cent per share。 So almost all of their contributed capital
    goes into APIC。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then they have retained earnings。 And I think I said last video that retained
    earnings always comes last。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， it didn't take long to find an exception to that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3M lists treasury stock and accumulated other comprehensive income after retained
    earnings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll talk about what these two items are。 Oops。 We'll talk about these two
    items much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much later in the course。 There's also this non-controlling interest stuff which
    we'll talk about later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then bottom line， total liabilities and stockholders' equity。 And in relic
    spotter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our assets equaled our liabilities plus equity and the same thing， for 3M。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No matter how big the company is， the two have to be equal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c9013ce26e989f6eabf3dee2d15b7cbc_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Wow。 What a mess。 So now you may be wondering， let's say I really need to know
    about prepaid assets for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3M。 Is there anywhere I can find them because I can't just go with this other
    current assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it's not going to tell me what I need to know about prepaids。 In footnote
    4 of the 10K。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is on page 66， 3M provides us some more detail on the， balance sheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So basically they break down some of those line items like other current assets，
    other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: assets and property plant equipment。 So that we can see our prepaid expenses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Property plant equipment at cost， so the original cost， here 3M provides us
    the breakdown。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c9013ce26e989f6eabf3dee2d15b7cbc_32.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: of land， buildings， machinery， construction leases to get the gross property
    plant equipment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c9013ce26e989f6eabf3dee2d15b7cbc_34.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Same thing with other current liabilities。 We get a breakdown into other kinds
    of payables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c9013ce26e989f6eabf3dee2d15b7cbc_36.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

    employee benefits。

  prefs: []

    two or three pages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c9013ce26e989f6eabf3dee2d15b7cbc_41.png)'
  prefs: []

- en: put as few lines as they could get away with on their balance sheet and then
    provided a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: footnote which gave us a breakdown of some of the other line items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there's not a section in the MDNA talking about these assets and liabilities
    in more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: detail because basically the footnotes tend to be oriented around a lot of these
    accounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so we see more detail in the footnotes。 So for example， here's note three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Goodwill and intangible assets。 This will tell us everything we need to know，
    hopefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about Goodwill and intangible assets。 So the additional balance sheet information
    we get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can usually go through the footnotes， and dig it out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the 3M。
