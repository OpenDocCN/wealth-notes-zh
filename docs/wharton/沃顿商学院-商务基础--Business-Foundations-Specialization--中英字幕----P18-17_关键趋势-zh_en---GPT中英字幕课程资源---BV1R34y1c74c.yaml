    the decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and interpersonal communications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    communication strategy is how do you say what you need to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are two types。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of appeals we focus on。 One is what we call as rational appeals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: types and we will discuss a few more few of each in this module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's think of first rational appeals。 A very popular and powerful rational
    appeal is what we call as product demonstration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we mean by product demonstration？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There are many products and services where we want to let the consumer or our
    buyers know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they deliver a particular point of difference or deliver a particular value
    proposition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that claim is not very easy to believe。 People may not believe why this
    particular shaving system does give you a better shave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at this particular ad you see there are four pictures in that one
    picture shows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's showing how this particular shaving method will actually give you a better
    shave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Let's look at another popular example that you may have seen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you see vacuum cleaner ads or washing machine ads they'll often focus on
    the technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the vacuum cleaner or the washing machine。 Dyson is a popular company that
    makes vacuum cleaners。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at any of their ads which you can see on YouTube you will see they
    often talk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the technology。 Why will this vacuum cleaner work better than other vacuum
    cleaners？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is what we call as the use of product demonstration in your communications
    campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a very strong rational appeal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another type of rational appeal is use of a spokesperson。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spokespersons if they use a product you believe they do well with the product
    you may also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feel that you will also be like them。 Again the use of a spokesperson at times
    is very expensive so you have to select your spokesperson。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very carefully otherwise it can be not a good value proposition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Some companies often use another type of a spokesperson which is a cartoon character。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or an inanimate object and they use this cartoon character or other cartoon
    characters like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that as a spokesperson。 Different than a spokesperson is the use of a testimonial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This comes from a regular user who then says look I use the product I feel good
    about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: you should also do the same。 Testimonials many people believe are more effective
    because they are coming from regular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: users and these regular users are not being paid to say something good about
    the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are doing it because they themselves find the product of the service useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another strong rational appeal that advertises use is product comparison。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They might compare their product against another product on a number of characteristics
    or holistically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say more people prefer our product to somebody else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever you use product comparisons it is very important that you follow the
    legal guidelines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for product comparison。 Most countries have very strong guidelines put in place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some countries actually do not allow direct product comparisons but those that
    do have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: strong legal requirements and you must follow those if you use product comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If done well this is a very strong rational appeal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Emotional appeals are another popular way of communicating your message and
    there are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different types of emotional appeals that we use。 Broadly classified as positive
    emotions or negative emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Positive emotions there are many examples of positive emotions that that advertises
    use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as they develop a campaign。 A good example of that is the Procter & Gamble campaign
    for Olympics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see children growing up， their mother is taking care of them and as the
    children grow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up you see them in playing or participating in one of the Olympic games doing
    very well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then you see the child actually hugging the mother and anytime you see this
    ad no matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how many times you see it at least whenever I see it I still have a tear in
    my eye。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is interesting about this campaign is when it was developed Procter & Gamble
    managers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were not very excited about it。 Why because it did not sell the product itself
    it only sold the company's name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is also an example of what we call as corporate image advertising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are good studies done including something we did many years ago along
    with one of my。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doctoral students on what type of company should use corporate advertising and
    what type of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company should not。 The general theme there was companies that use a common
    brand name across many of their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products should use corporate advertising and those that use different brand
    names or a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: house of brand so to say versus a branded house as Professor Bhabra Khan mentioned
    in her。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: module wherever you have a branded house there is a stronger case for using
    corporate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: advertising and Procter & Gamble it turns out does not use a branded house it
    uses a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: house of brands。 Another strong emotion that we use in developing a communications
    campaign is fear that is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the negative emotions we use。 What is interesting about fear is we have
    found that too little fear does not have much effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: too much fear also in a campaign does not have much effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So the efficiency of fear goes down if there is too much of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a question can be asked is why too much fear is not good in a campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What advertisers have found is that if you use too much fear in your advertising
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get turned off in fact they do not even remember seeing that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it is very important that if you use fear in a mass media kind of a setting
    you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moderate levels of fear in your campaign that is what researchers say in their
    work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/859998fb2ed401304410fe05377b3e9e_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: One way to moderate the effect of fear is to combine it with humor and there
    are many examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of that when you look at many of the pharmaceutical company ads here is one
    example where you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: germs but we never show germs as real germs we will show them as nice looking
    cartoon， characters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So at least there is fear but it is moderated by using humor。
  prefs: []
