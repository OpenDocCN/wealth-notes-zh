- en: As we discussed in the last video， the framework that we will use to look at
    the world in this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/64574e366d8fd93e346a32e02566bd89_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: course is process analysis。 There sounds a little dry and technical， but don't
    worry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is really not brain surgery。 In this video I want to practice these definitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though most of my work relates to service operations， a number of years ago
    I did some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work on an iron-on processing plant。 Though the headquarters of the company
    we worked with was in Cleveland。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ohio， the plant itself， was entrinodent。 Here is a brief cut of iron ore produced
    by the plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's see how it is made。 When you're landing entrinodent you actually see the
    plant from the airplane。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a plant。 It takes iron ore finds as input and it spits out these lovely
    brickheads as output。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It looks like a big monster。 The monster is a highly sophisticated plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a real masterpiece of engineering。 The plant is the size of several football
    fields。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I spare you the technical details。 Here you see the engineering drawings of
    the plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It looks a bit like a blueprint when you're building a house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see a number of large machines that will be the resources in all processes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now in this course we look at a plant not as an engineering drawing but as a
    process flow， diagram。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember in a process flow diagram there are boxes， arrows and triangles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This like the brickheading machine shown in this photo capture resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Resources are adding value to the flow unit。 They help advance the flow unit
    on its journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we discussed in the last video resources have capacities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At any given moment of time some flow units are sitting in these resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example tons of iron ore will be in the reactors of the plant。 But most
    of the iron ore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the real inventory， sits at the beginning of the plant between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: resources or at the end of the process。 This is visualized with the triangles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often times we refer to those triangles as buffers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key distinction setting buffers apart from resources is that they do not
    add value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flow unit does not have to spend time at a buffer and it still can come
    out as a good， unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can be a happily completed flow unit and have never spent a minute in a
    buffer。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So here is what the process flow diagram looks like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I do here is I overlay the process flow diagram with the engineering drawings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don't have to do this but I thought it would be kind of cool from a pedagogical，
    perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that explains the arrangements of the boxes。 You see the input and the output。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pile of iron ore finds are the input and the piles of briquettes are the
    output。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you see the main processing steps。 Starting with a preheater all the
    way to the briqueting machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seven steps， seven boxes。 What we want to do is to find the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much can this plan produce？ What is the process capacity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To answer these questions we have to find the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when looking for the bottleneck we have to look at the resources and their
    capacity， levels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this example we have the preheater， the lock hoppers， the first reactor，
    the second， reactor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the flesh eater， the discharge and finally that briqueting machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that the triangles are inventories and they're not in the race for being
    the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to look for the resource with the lowest capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That clearly is the second reactor with the capacity of 100 tons per hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that is the bottleneck。 And that's the process capacity is 100 tons per hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The chain is only as strong as its weakest link。 To find the flow rate remember
    the flow rate is the minimum between demand and capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming there's enough iron ore to be processed and enough demand to sell this
    stuff our flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rate would be equal to the process capacity at 100 tons per hour。 My father
    is an engineer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my brother is an engineer， I'm not。 And believe me they have reminded me many
    times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in order to understand and improve an operation even something as complex
    as an iron。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ore plant you don't necessarily need an engineering degree。 All these technical
    details， heaters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different types of reactors， heat exchangers， yes somebody， better understands
    how this stuff works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that somebody doesn't have to be you。 Notice that at the end of the day
    few of these details actually matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact for most business related calculations the single most important number
    is the capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the bottleneck。 This plant produces 100 tons per hour。 That is a crucial
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bottleneck is a constraint on the system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/64574e366d8fd93e346a32e02566bd89_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And as I said before the bottleneck is really the key concept in this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when you look at an operation always ask yourself where is the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See you in the next video。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
