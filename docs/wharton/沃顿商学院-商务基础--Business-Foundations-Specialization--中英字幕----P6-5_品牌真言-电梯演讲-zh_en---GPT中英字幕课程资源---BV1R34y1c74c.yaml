    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mind when you think of the brand。 And then there's lots of different ways to
    do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'll just show you one， but there are a lot of different ways。 And you write
    down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the brand is， what the essence of the brand is from the consumer point
    of view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the different associations are and how those associations lead to other
    associations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And some people call this mental map。 Some people call them schemas。 And there's
    a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the circle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can be how often that association is named by different people。 The lines that

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    essentially what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with what differentiates McDonald's。 You think about the golden arches， the
    brand name。 And， then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    makes meals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the yellow。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's lots of other ones that you can come up with。 But。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see the idea here is that you have circles and lines that connect these
    associations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can do this in a lot of different ways。 You can do it the closest ones to
    the core。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or the ones that are at top of mind that come up first， the ones that are further
    away， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come up after a time。 And so there are a lot of things。 But what I'm trying
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get here is all of the thought associations that come up with a brand。 And then
    what you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to do is do this over several customers and do it in market research stages
    several。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different ways。 And essentially you want to take all these different abstract
    phrases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and concepts that are out there and figure out which are the most important，
    maybe five， to ten。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which are the very most important。 And so what you're doing is you're starting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the mental map or the associations that people have with the brand or maybe
    with the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: category and depending upon how well known the brand is， you might do it at
    a category level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might do it at a what if level， you might do it at a prototype level， a
    concept level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or the brand level。 But you have this big mental map and then you want to hone
    down that mental。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: map to the core brand values which are the five or ten critical brand values
    that are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: important to that brand。 And from that you then want to reduce those five or
    ten to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: key concepts that are going to be the DNA of the brand， the brand mantra。 So
    the brand。
  prefs: []

    come out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with all your new products， all your advertising has to all fit within the essence。
    The customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is going to know the brand mantra， the employees are going to know the brand
    mantra， you really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want， if you have a very very strong brand， it's very crystal clear what that
    brand is。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: different platforms， these different products。 So what is the essence of the
    brand mantra？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the product or service。 It describes the type of experiences， the benefits that

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    nature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of what the brand is delivering and then there's an emotional qualifier that
    kind of explains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exactly what those benefits are and in what way the brand delivers on those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's probably easier to give you some examples。 Before I do that though， let
    me just say again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d5ff6282cac4050ed4e1b65f07d93ddc_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: what the brand mantra is used for。 It's used internally to guide decisions。
    I think already。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mentioned this。 It's what the brand shouldn't， should not be。 By the way， that's
    a very important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: idea。 A brand mantra not only says what a brand is but as importantly it says
    what， a brand is not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you really want to have almost black and white that idea。 This is， a Nike，
    this is not a Nike。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d5ff6282cac4050ed4e1b65f07d93ddc_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: brand。 It has to be short， simple and it should be inspirational。 So now we
    have the examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are very famous ones。 Nike， they're global brands。 Nike， Disney， McDonald's。
    So Nike。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is authentic athletic performance。 They just do it， be real， you know， that's
    authentic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's very much an athletic brand。 It's not just shoes， it's clothing。 But when
    you think， of Nike。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you think about athletic and it's about performance。 The technique or the ability，
    to， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just do it， that kind of notion。 Disney and McDonald's are kind of interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because they both are about family fun。 And they actually both have a lot of
    things in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: common but the brand mantra is different。 Disney is about entertainment。 Now
    that is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not to say that Disney doesn't have food。 Disney sells quite a bit of food at
    their parks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in different places that they have。 But when you think Disney， you think
    fun， family。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: entertainment。 And even the food comes within that brand mantra of Disney， of
    entertainment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: McDonald's on the other hand is fun and family but it's food。 And even if you
    have a McDonald's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: playground or something like that， you still think of it as the food first。
    And so although。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d5ff6282cac4050ed4e1b65f07d93ddc_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: these are similar and， you know， in some sense， you can see they're actually
    also quite， quite。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different。 And I don't think you'd ever get Disney and McDonald's confused。
    Even though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're going after similar target markets and they're offering similar emotional
    benefits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they really are quite， quite distinct， different brands。 And they have very
    different brand。
