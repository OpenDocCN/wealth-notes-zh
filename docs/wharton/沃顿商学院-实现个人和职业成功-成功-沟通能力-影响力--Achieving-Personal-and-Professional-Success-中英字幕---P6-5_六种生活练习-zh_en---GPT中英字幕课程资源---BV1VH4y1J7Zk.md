When we teach success， here at Wharton， one of the things we do is offer the students。

![](img/2078ee3d537ea20d5e7290ec33f01253_1.png)

exercises， mind puzzles， little homework things that allow them to think about their own success。

values and their own emotions and their own capabilities。 And then when we come together。

we talk about the different answers people got。 In this setting。

what we're going to do is offer you the same exercises and then give， you a chance to do them。

And then I'll come back and I'll be able to share with you some of the range of responses。

that I've received from these exercises either in the classroom or in executive sessions。

with senior executives or online where I've got thousands of people who've taken some。

of these assessments。 And that way it'll give you a chance to benchmark your own answers and think about them in。

light of these other responses。 So let's get started with the first one。

It's the one we use in the first class here in the success course at Wharton。

I call it the Six Lives Exercise。 And it's really very simple。 There are six short paragraphs。

each one telling the story of an individual in a different， career setting。

Then you have to read each of those paragraphs。 It's sort of on。

if you printed it out of being one side and the other side of a single， piece of paper。

And then think about these six stories。 And then the final part is the part that's going to give us something to work with。

I need you to rate the lives from number one， the most successful life as you see it， to。

number six， the least successful life as you see it。

And we just try to make it so that each life gets an individual number， so there's no ties， allowed。

So you're going to be reading these six little vignettes， you're going to be thinking about， it。

and then you're going to rank them。 Number one is the most successful， down to number six。

the least successful。 And then bring your answers to the session where we talk about some of the context for。

this。 And I think you'll begin to see how this helps you access what some of your implicit values。

are when it comes to this magic word that we're going to be studying the word success。

So let's take a moment， take the exercise， and I'll be back in a second to talk about， your results。
