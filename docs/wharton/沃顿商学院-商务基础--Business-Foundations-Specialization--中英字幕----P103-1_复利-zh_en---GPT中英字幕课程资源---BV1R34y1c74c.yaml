  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: namely the timeline and the discount factor， and then we showed how to move
    money back in time via discounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today， I want to go the other direction。 I want to move money forward in time
    via a process called compounding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's get started。 Hey everyone， welcome back to Corporate Finance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today we're going to be talking about compounding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but let me start off with a brief recap of what we did in the last lecture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last time we introduced the time value of money， the concept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We started off with some intuition and showed that money has a time unit that
    prevents money arriving at different points in time from being aggregated or added
    together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we introduced some tools associated with the time value of money， notably
    the timeline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is just a visual representation of when money is moving in or out， and
    the discount factor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which was our exchange rate for the time value of money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It allowed us to convert the time units on money moving it forward or backward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we applied those tools to move cash flows back in time via discounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big lesson was don't add cash flows with different time units ever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today I want to go the other direction and talk about compounding or moving
    cash flows forward in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's get started。 Compounding just refers to moving cash flows forward in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's our familiar timeline。 What I'm doing is I'm taking each cash flow， CF-0，
    1， 2， and 3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moving them forward to period 4 via compounding。 So focusing on cash flow 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I move that forward to period 4 by taking cash flow 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: multiplying it by my discount factor raised to the power of 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because I'm moving it 2 periods forward， and it's positive because I'm moving
    it forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're generally all of the exponents are positive， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because we're moving all of the cash flows forward in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can add all of these cash flows now because they're all in the same time units，
    namely， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can add all of these cash flows。 They're all in date 4 time units。 Now these
    cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once they've been moved forward， are referred to as future values。 So， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is just notation like with present values。 This is the future value as
    of period 4 of cash flow 3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the future value as of period 4 of cash flow 2， and likewise for cash flows
    1 and 0。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's do an example。 How much money will I have after 3 years if I invest $1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 in a savings account paying 3。5% interest per annum？ Well， step 1， put down
    a cash line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Put down a timeline。 Put the cash flows on a timeline。 So， I'm going to invest
    $1，000 today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: period 0， and the question's asking how much money will I have in 3 years？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all we're going to do is move the cash flow forward in time by compounding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to multiply by 1 plus r， where r is 3。5% in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'm moving the cash flow 3 years forward in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that's a positive 3 exponent on my discount factor。 If we do the arithmetic，
    we get that the $1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 is worth $1，108。72 or just under $0。72。 And I should also mention that this
    is just the future value of the $1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000， in particular it's the future value as of period 3 of the cash flow in
    period 0， which was $1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000。 Let's do a second example。 How much money will we have for years from today
    if we save $1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 a year beginning today for the next 3 years， assuming we are in 5% per annum？
    Step 1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the cash flows on a timeline。 That's exactly right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're saving $100 a year beginning today for the next 3 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to earn 5% and I want to know how much I have after 4 years。 Well，
    to do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to have to move each cash flow forward in time to period 4。 So look
    at cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the cash flow in period 3。 I need to move that forward 1 period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so I multiply by 1 plus r raised to the positive power 1。 We're going forward
    1 period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cash flow 2 has to go forward 2 periods， so we're going to multiply that by
    our discount factor raised to the power positive 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And likewise for cash flows arriving in， or the cash flows in period 0 today
    and 1 year from today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we do the arithmetic， we get these future values of the cash flows， right？
    105， 110， 115， 121。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can now add all of these cash flows because they're all in the same time
    for period 4 time units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if we do that， I get 4。52。564。 So what does this mean？ How do we interpret
    that？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we will have $452。56 at the end of 4 years if we save $100 starting today for
    the next 3 years and our money earns 5% per annum。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The future value for years from today of saving $100 starting today for the
    next 3 years at 5% per annum is $452。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 56。 So what's going on here？ What's going on behind the scenes？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to deposit $100 today。 That's going to earn 5% interest and give
    us an additional $5 at the end of year 1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So our pre-deposit balance that's pre before our next deposit is just $105。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which by the way is also equal to the future value one period hence of the $100，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The future value of this $100 one period hence is just the 100 times the 1 plus
    r to the 1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I deposit another $100 and I've got $205 after the first year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We continue this process for 4 years and lo and behold， we're left with $452。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 56 at the end of the fourth year。 More generally， there's nothing special about
    moving the cash flows to the end of the timeline or the beginning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can move them anywhere。 Just as long as you're consistent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can pick any point in time such as period 2。 And I can move cash flows 3
    and 4 back in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to buy applying a discount factor raised to a negative value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can move the cash flows today and the cash flow one year from today forward
    in time by applying a positive exponent to the discount factor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now these cash flows here are all in the same time to period units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/105489559f32bde12dbcb0600540aa92_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: All right， so let's summarize this up。 We use compounding to move cash flows
    forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We apply a discount factor with a positive exponent to move them forward in
    time and that gets us future values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I want to see you do now is work on the problem set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then coming up next in our next lecture， I want to talk about some useful
    shortcuts for present value and future value of common streams of cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So thanks again for listening and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
