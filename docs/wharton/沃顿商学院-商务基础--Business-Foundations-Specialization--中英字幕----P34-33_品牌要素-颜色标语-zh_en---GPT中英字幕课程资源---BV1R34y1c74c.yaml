    color。
  prefs: []

    black card。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how stimulating it is versus how calming it is， and there's the affect access。
  prefs: []

    important。

    some cultures than others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what I'll show you here is kind of the way the U。S。 looks at it。

    colors are like red and orange。
  prefs: []

- en: Those create much more attention， much more excitement， and calming colors are
    more blue and green。
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so there's certain things that we know about the way people automatically
    react to these colors。

    exciting color。
  prefs: []

- en: It gets attention。 It's part of the reason why fire engines are red， or sometimes
    they're yellow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both of them are very attention-getting colors。 Red also means love， it means
    passion。

    McDonald's， Pizza Hut。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: KFC， Windows， Chipotle， Wendy's， Chipotle。 They all stimulate appetite and they
    all have a lot of red in their logo。

    tranquil， means health。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it can mean money， it can mean nature。 A lot of environmental companies use
    the green color to give you that green notion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    ads and you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's kind of maybe not the best color to paint for a newborn's room。 Orange
    is exciting， warm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's an enthusiastic color。 Lavender， on the other hand， is calming， more relaxing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    mentioned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is more of a girl's color， it's warm， it's a calming color， very feminine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so one of the things you can look at is look at some of these different
    colors and see which companies use these different colors。

    food companies。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: green is more of this natural color， Whole Foods uses it， Starbucks uses it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the oil companies have used it to show that they have environmental
    leanings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BP has tried to use it。 And then the gray， black and white colors are more of
    a balanced color。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see New York Times is a black logo。 Apple sometimes says that Silver Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mercedes-Benz is a silver kind of color。 So， those colors。
  prefs: []
