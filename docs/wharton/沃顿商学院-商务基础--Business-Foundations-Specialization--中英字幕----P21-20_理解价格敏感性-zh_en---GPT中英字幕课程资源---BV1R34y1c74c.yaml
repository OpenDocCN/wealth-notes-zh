- en: and price elasticity。 In this module we will focus on this particular aspect
    in more detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will do it in two parts。 In the first part we will think about what drives
    price sensitivity or price elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words， under what conditions are consumers more or less price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we know this we get some useful directional guidelines on when to price higher
    and when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to price lower。 The next part of this module we will talk about formal methods
    of measuring price elasticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and of course before we do that we will define formally what price elasticity
    means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's start with the first one， drivers of price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are things we know from previous research and previous observations and
    are fairly robust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: findings。 So what are the things we are going to focus on？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are going to focus on seven different drivers of price sensitivity starting
    with availability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and awareness of substitutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0f28d5c6a6d2d91f3ec47b8f6d0dae17_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I think it's not very complicated to recognize that if your product has more
    substitutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people will be more price sensitive。 So this is very straightforward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More substitutes that exist greater will be the price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is important is it's not just the availability of substitutes even awareness
    of substitutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: matters。 So for example， I live close to Philadelphia， I work in Philadelphia，
    so I know a lot of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: restaurants in Philadelphia。 So if I am price sensitive about where to eat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have good information of various restaurants， their prices， I'll be more price
    sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if I go on a vacation， let's say I go on a vacation to Paris or another
    city which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not very familiar with， I don't know many restaurants there， I'll be less
    price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Probably there are more restaurants in Paris than there are in Philadelphia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are more substitutes available in Paris， but my price sensitivity in
    Paris is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to be lower because I'm not aware of all of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0f28d5c6a6d2d91f3ec47b8f6d0dae17_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another important concept to keep in mind is it's not just availability and
    awareness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how easy it is for us to make direct comparisons， makes price sensitivity higher
    or lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me give you an example from my own research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do a lot of work on private labels at generics。 Professor Kant talked about
    private labels earlier also in her module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Private labels command a very high share in the US market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not just because they are priced lower than major national brands， but because
    they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kept right next to major national brands on the same shelf。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So consumers can easily see that national brands say Tylenol cost this much
    and Acinomifene。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: produced by Walmart or sold under the Walmart name cost much less and they are
    kept right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: next to them。 So many people choose the store brand。 Think of the following
    scenario。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose all these store brands were put on a separate shelf in the store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like generics were put on a separate shelf many years ago in some stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If all the private labels of various categories were taken out and put on a
    separate aisle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in another part of the store one of our papers that we did for a company indicated
    that the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: share of private labels will fall by 10%。 So it's not just it's not just the
    availability of private labels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's our ability to compare the private label price with the national brand
    in a very easy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way that increases our price sensitivity。 So availability of substitutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: awareness of substitutes and then how easy it is for us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to compare the price of one product against another and even small changes there
    make a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: big difference in price sensitivity。 Another important driver of price sensitivity
    that we've observed is what is the total expenditure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the product and also what is the total expenditure on this product as a fraction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of your total cost。 So let me give you examples of both。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you spend more on a product or a service you are going to be more price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bigger families are more sensitive to the price of groceries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why because for a bigger family their expenditure on groceries is a bigger part
    of their budget。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they are more price sensitive。 So if you spend more on a product or a service
    you are usually more price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is also interesting is the same product if it's a bigger part of your cost
    structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you will be more price sensitive。 If it's a very small part of your cost structure
    you will be less price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's say if I'm making a steel furniture I'll be more sensitive to the price
    of steel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than somebody who makes wooden furniture and uses steel nails。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now steel is still steel but the cost of nails as a fraction of the total cost
    is much smaller。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for somebody who makes wooden furniture as compared to the price of steel that
    goes into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: steel furniture。 So even though we have the same metal steel the person who
    is more price sensitive to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the steel is the person who makes a steel furniture as opposed to the person
    who makes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wooden furniture。 Now this one is not very surprising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If somebody else is sharing a part of the bill you are going to be less price
    sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people observe this that if your company is paying for your airfare you will
    probably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not as search as much for a lower cost of light。 How do you tackle that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well you may want to give your employees some incentive in terms of some shared
    benefit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if they are finding a lower price。 Another example is when you are pharmaceuticals
    or the products that you buy in a pharmacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when they are covered by insurance you are likely to be less price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do companies encourage people to become more price sensitive and buy
    the cheaper product？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you go through the insurance company and lower the price let us say if a
    drug costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a hundred dollars insurance company pays 80 percent you pay only 20 you are
    going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pay 20 and the insurance company picks up 80。 Alright well if you lower the
    price from 100 to 50 what will happen？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will pay 10 instead of 20。 Who is getting the biggest advantage it is the
    insurance company but if you can give。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a direct to consumer discount then the consumer sees a bigger benefit of that
    discount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So whenever you have shared expenses and you want the consumer to actually be
    more more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: price sensitive you give a direct to consumer discount as as opposed to lowering
    the price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the product directly。 Your switching costs affects price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I already have a big car a big SUV for example I have a V8 SUV that I
    have owned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for 10 years it still works well so I do not change it even though my kids tell
    me to buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a new one。 But because I already have a big SUV when the price of gasoline increases
    I still fill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it up I am not very price sensitive to it even though I want to be I have no
    choice because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I get only 15 miles per gallon if I were able to change my car then I would
    become more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: price sensitive but I am stuck with a particular car or a particular SUV in
    this case so when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the price of gasoline changes my behavior does not change I still have to go
    to the office。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: every week or every day of the week I pretty much go 6 days a week so I still
    consume as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much gasoline as I did even when the price was lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An area that is also important to think about is price quality relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many product categories where consumers infer the quality of the product
    from the price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so many people say perfumes is one example of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me give you some more examples that may be even more relevant consulting
    services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: legal services， choice of a doctor， financial advisors or retirement planning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In all these cases what we find is people infer quality of the product from
    the price。 Why is that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the common driver？ The common driver here is consumers lack of knowledge
    about the product of the service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do not know who is the best legal professional because I do not use them very
    often but if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have somebody who is really cheap I might infer from their lower price that
    they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not very good whereas the somebody who charges a lot may be better because why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because if other people are willing to pay more for them they must be good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am not very knowledgeable about this service and if I find that the market
    is willing to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pay more for them they must be good。 And this is consumers lack of knowledge
    that drives price quality relationship because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the cost of error is very high in all these settings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0f28d5c6a6d2d91f3ec47b8f6d0dae17_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Price quality relationships happen in other areas too with a very similar kind
    of an idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same wine when price differently people think that the wine that is more
    expensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0f28d5c6a6d2d91f3ec47b8f6d0dae17_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: is better。 Again this happens more with novice wine drinkers as opposed to knowledgeable
    wine drinkers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowledgeable wine drinkers will not show as much price quality effects as as
    novices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And by the way we have seen many studies which are brain scans where for novice
    drinkers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see this effect very strongly。 Another area that affects consumers price
    sensitivity is their ability to carry inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0f28d5c6a6d2d91f3ec47b8f6d0dae17_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If a consumer can buy an advance for future consumption they can take advantage
    of lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: prices they become more price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0f28d5c6a6d2d91f3ec47b8f6d0dae17_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If a consumer is not able to carry inventory for example say products like milk
    fresh vegetables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where you can't store them for a long time people are less price sensitive because
    when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the product is on sale you can't buy it for the next month of consumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas for cereal and many other products people find that if the product is
    on sale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people buy a lot more of it because they can store the product for future consumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these are some of the instances where we see people becoming more or less
    price sensitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: based on the scenario they face。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
