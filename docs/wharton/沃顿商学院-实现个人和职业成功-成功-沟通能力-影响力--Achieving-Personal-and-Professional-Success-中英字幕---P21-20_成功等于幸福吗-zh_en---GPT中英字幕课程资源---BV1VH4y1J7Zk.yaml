  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the United States， in Western Europe， in Western countries， we make a lot
    of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: word happiness。 It's in the Declaration of Independence that we're supposed
    to pursue happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    one thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they don't get it， they think there's something wrong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think it's important to at least think about three different kinds of happiness
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the research helps us think about this。 If you want to read some more about
    these some of these forms of happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Daniel Kahneman， a Nobel Prize winning psychologist from Princeton has a wonderful
    book called Thinking Fast and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Slow has a chapter or two on happiness that distills a lot of this research
    into a pretty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: efficient capsule but we're going to talk about it a little bit here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first kind of happiness that most people think about when they think
    about the word。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is what I call momentary happiness。 Now momentary happiness is an emotion。 It's
    a mood。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a moment that comes and where you're having a positive feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good example might be you are at the beach。 It's been a pretty hot day。 You
    go to the boardwalk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a soft serve ice cream vendor there。 They have your favorite flavor。
    You get into the shade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You've ordered your soft serve ice cream。 It's dipped in whatever it is that
    you love as a little covering chocolate or strawberry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or something and you have that first bite of that ice cream cone and it just
    tastes wonderful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's momentary happiness。 Could be the same thing if you're a fan of drinking
    beer and it's the same kind of day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they have the favorite beer that you like and you take that first sip of
    whatever the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: drink is that you find most enjoyable and it just fills you with this feeling
    of happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So momentary happiness is great。 I think the more of it you have the better
    your days are but there's some problems with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: momentary happiness as a measure of success in life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So research says that there are genetic set points that people have that go
    into their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: emotional makeups and some people are kind of positive people and some people
    are less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: positive and some people are kind of negative people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And your mood state swings on a given day or during a given period of time sort
    of above。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that genetic set point when you take that first bite of the ice cream cone but
    then somewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little later dips below that set point as you begin feeling really hot and
    sweaty on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the beach and you wish that the sun weren't so bright and now you're not in
    such a happy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mood state。 Maybe somebody comes along a dog comes along and puts sand in your
    drink on the beach and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now you're really kind of upset and angry with somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So your genetic set point just tells you whoops going down here but it is arranged
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: chances are you're not going to have too many moments when you're above the
    highest point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of that range。 You're not going to have too many moments when you're below the
    low point of that range。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my range is different than yours。 My best day may be just in the average
    domain for your day and you get to be a lot happier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than me because your genetic set point is different。 So if happiness of this
    kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this sort of aggregate number of mood states is set by， our genes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it seems sort of unfair to say that you're more successful than me because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have more positive mood states than I do because you're endowed with a different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: set of genes than I was。 So there's the problem of kind of no free will when
    it comes to how many happiness moments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you get and it seems like success ought to have something to do with choices
    we make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are a lot of pretty intelligent people who have thought about the
    question of happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and kind of come to the conclusion that these positive momentary mood states
    really don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rise to the level of kind of nobility or purpose that you would want in a theory
    of success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Albert Einstein once said that a theory of success that's built on momentary
    mood states。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was more like the happiness of a cow than something that humans ought to endorse
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you kind of go by a farm and look out at a herd of cattle they're happily
    grazing， out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're， you know， in the sun they're well watered， they're well fed， everything's
    good。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have a pretty happy cow。 But would you really say that that's a successful
    life that would be something you would be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: satisfied with at the end of your days？ I'm not sure。 So positive mood states，
    good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this is the only form of happiness that you might call success， maybe not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So second kind of happiness and this again is research based。 By the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way they measure momentary happiness is with little beepers they put， on
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They'll put a little beeper like a cell phone or a clip and you walk around
    during the day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the experimenters beep you and at the moment they beep you you have to take
    off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the little device and you know put where how you feel you know excellent， bad，
    terrible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you just put the moment when you feel it and at the end of a week they measure
    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many positive moments you have and that's how they decide whether you're happy
    or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the momentary happiness。 Now we go to the second one and I call this
    overall happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And overall happiness is not an emotion。 It's a thought。 It's an evaluation。
    It's a critique。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you may reach a point either a progression in part of your life or an anticipation
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another part of your life and look back if you're looking backwards at say your
    college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experience and someone asks you were you happy in college and you don't know
    whether you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can really add up all the positive mood stays but for some reason you feel like
    yeah you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know important things happen。 I met my spouse in college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I you know I graduated and so yeah overall I was happy in college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But actually if you go back and you had that beeper all the way through college
    you would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: find as often as not that you are much more miserable in college than you remember
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you only really remember the peak the day you met your spouse to be and the
    ending which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was the graduation ceremony when your family came and everybody applauded you
    and it was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a great moment you got a prize。 And all the rest of it that whole miserable
    sophomore year all the hangovers and other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: disasters that occurred that made you miserable pretty much fade out of you
    and just you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: disappear into the past。 So overall happiness is a moment in time when you evaluate
    but not always accurate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact the research seems to show that if you give someone a cookie or some
    other thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they like and they put them in a positive momentary mood state their memories
    of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: past might actually be colored by the fact that they're in a good mood and they'll
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their overall happiness higher and if you put them in a negative mood state
    their memories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will cast back and select out more negative things and their overall happiness
    might be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little bit lower。 So it's not that hard to manipulate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have the problem of selected memory we have the problem of easy manipulation
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know it's all there's always a fundamental problem with any evaluation and
    that is it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: always relative to some baseline expectation。 So if you thought college was
    going to be miserable and it turned out to be okay that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to give you a feeling that you're happy。 If you thought college was going
    to be wonderful and it turned out to be okay then you're going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to evaluate it more negatively。 So your overall experience is going to be cast
    in a frame manipulatable by what your expectations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were。 And so again it's just a cognitive phenomenon almost a paradox that we
    can think about the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: past and even the future in our anticipation differently depending on what our
    moods are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what our evaluative criteria are and that's all very interesting as a matter
    of sort of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cognitive psychology。 My challenge to you is is this really the way you want
    to measure success is it just going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be all about some moment in time when you say my overall happiness was X
    at time past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or I anticipated to be Y in time future and it seems like that's a pretty flimsy
    read to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: place the weight of your meaning in life on。 So overall happiness interesting
    probably helps you get motivated and helps you tell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stories but not necessarily the final story about how you measure success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the third kind of happiness is something quite different than both momentary
    happiness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and overall happiness。 Like momentary happiness it's an emotion but unlike momentary
    happiness it has a lot more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: resonance it has a lot more depth a lot more meaning associated with it than
    eating ice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cream con does on the hot summer day。 I call this deep happiness but it comes
    with a lot of different names that people have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tried to give to it over the thousands of years that humans have tried to grapple
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the meaning of success。 Certainly one word in English that might have captured
    this is joy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Joy is sort of the exaltation that you feel say on the birth of a one of your
    first child。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or one of your children it might be a kind of feeling of connection when you
    are in an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: amazing place in nature and you simply feel the awe and the inspiration of the
    vista that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in front of you。 It could be the feelings that you have when you fall in love
    and you just have this mysterious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: new amazing feeling of connection and depth to the relationship that suddenly
    blossomed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So joy is a good word that might capture it。 The Greeks had a word for this
    called Yuday Mania it translates from the Greek as good spirit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and Aristotle wrote about it in his book on ethics and it's an interesting Greek
    concept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it's not a state for them it's not an emotion for the Greeks it was
    a kind of thriving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of flourishing a kind of activity in which your excellence is embodied
    in an activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that gives meaning to those around you and that is an end of itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're doing it because you love doing it you're not doing it for any other
    purpose。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Yuday Mania is a Greek word that captures this sort of thriving sense that
    I think deep。

    out to me one semester Simka is a Hebrew。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: word that normally is more like momentary happiness it's a happiness that might
    be the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: case if you're celebrating a wedding or a birth but there was a rabbi that defined
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially in a way that I resonated with and he translated as the feeling that
    comes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you're doing what you should be doing the feeling that comes when you're
    doing what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should be doing。 So this might be the kind of feeling when you're sitting
    with someone and you're comforting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them or you're being with them when they're in the hospital with an illness
    and your presence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has given them a moment of relief from the suffering that they're feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I had a student once who came to me and he said he was going to have to miss
    the next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: class because his grandfather died and he had been asked by the family to speak
    at his。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grandfather's funeral and so this always is a good excuse in my world for not
    being able。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to come to classes an event like that but we were talking about how he felt
    about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and he felt nervous he felt the sadness that his grandfather who he was close
    to had passed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I predicted for him I said when you're at this funeral and you're speaking
    about your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grandfather I think you're going to have a moment of something like deep happiness
    because。
  prefs: []

    on the。

    of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thought what deep happiness means this feeling。 So so this seems like a worthy
    thing to be identifying with success certainly the more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moments of thriving joy being where you should be a flow that your life has
    you'd count that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    really。
  prefs: []
