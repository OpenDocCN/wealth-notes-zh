- en: to 60 percent of individuals who say you know what I would have bought the product
    in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: store but I ended up buying it online instead。 So my two colleagues Tony Moreno
    at the Caloog School of Management and Santiago Galano。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're at the tuck school investigated this through something they called BOPS
    buy online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pick up in store as a way for traditional retailers to fight back against this
    phenomenon of show。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rooming。 So the idea of buy online pick up in store is the following。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can go to the website of a large retailer and Tony and Santiago looked at
    a large retailer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: operating both within the United States and Canada that had about 80 or 100
    stores in this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: analysis and the retailer implemented a program where you could buy the product
    online then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: go to the store and pick it up BOPS buy online pick up in store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what they found was the following you might hope actually that sales
    at the websites。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would then go up because now as a consumer I can go on to the website I can
    see that this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coffee maker that I'm interested in is in stock and then I can buy it online
    and go to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the store on the way home and pick it up。 So the hope was that by offering consumers
    this option that the sales at the website would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: increase and I should mention that the retailer in question I cannot disclose
    the name but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the retailer in question was mainly selling products that are for your home
    so betting， towels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coffee makers those kinds of things and this is very important for the explanation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that comes later on。 Now what Tony and Santiago found is instead of sales at
    the website going up sales at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the website actually went down doesn't sound too good but there's a silver lining
    they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: found after this BOPS was implemented sales in the stores went up。 So what was
    happening？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine myself as a consumer I want to buy a coffee machine from this particular
    retailer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I go to the website I see that the product is in stock and the price is good
    but because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a coffee machine I'd still like to perhaps taste the coffee or touch the
    sweeter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or try out the betting。 So because most of what this retailer was selling was
    products that required some physical inspection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the customer to make them feel comfortable what the customers were doing
    were going online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to make sure the product was there then going into the store and actually purchasing
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the store right down in there。 So offering that option was very valuable and
    actually led to an overall increase in sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at that retailer so much so that the new acronym instead of BOPS buy online
    pick up in store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tony and Santiago referred to this as ROPO ROPO research online purchase offline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again those of you who are facing these kind of omni channel problems and
    horizontal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: free writing show rooming for your own business this shows that this potentially
    clever ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out by really understanding what the consumers want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They want information first but they want to touch and feel the product and
    if you can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deliver them that package you can get yourself out of some of these traps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now let me just summarize what we've talked about in terms of horizontal free
    writing and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how this can be illuminated。 There's essentially free broad strategies that
    can be put into place in a particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: market to try and eliminate this problem between Chris and Amy where Chris is
    the high price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the high service seller and the customer goes to his store to get the information
    and then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goes to Amy store to get the lower price。 The first thing that you could do
    is you could make sure that in different territories different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products are available so give Chris some of the product line and give Amy something
    else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so there's not direct competition between them。 Related to that you might need
    to think carefully about the appropriate level of distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: intensity。 If a lot of horizontal free writing is going on you might want to
    make your distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: intensity a little bit lower and be more exclusive or more selective meaning
    that local retailers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have kind of a local monopoly。 And then finally the other thing that you could
    do is you could introduce different brands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for different retailers。 So literally just call the product different names
    so Chris's product has a slightly different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: label on it than Amy's does and this again works against the problem of direct
    comparison。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is an important component of horizontal free writing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_26.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So now let me summarize everything that we've been talking about so far in this
    module with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: respect to conflict。 Here's three rules of thumb that have been discovered through
    academic research and to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just generally what causes more conflict in a channel of distribution or a system
    of distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_28.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So three things we're going to look at first of all are the length of the channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how many players are there between the person who provides the product initially
    or creates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it and the person who ends up buying it。 Secondly how much autonomy is there
    in the channel are all of the channel members owned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the corporate entity so they're all stores owned by Starbucks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are they mainly franchise so McDonald's might have franchisees or are they all
    completely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: independent agents and then thirdly how much density is there in the channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is there only one retailer or distributor in a particular market are there two
    or are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: there multiple。 So this is what the researchers found with respect to these
    three important factors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_32.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So generally as the channel gets longer and longer there is just more potential
    for conflict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_34.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and there's one really fundamental reason for this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a term that was developed by a French economist many centuries ago and
    it's called。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: double marginalization。 It's a fancy term it's a simple idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It says every time you add someone between the producer and the end consumer
    you're adding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a markup and a layer of margin。 So if you have one retailer between the customer
    and the end user there'll be two levels of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: markup from the manufacturer to the retailer and then the retailer to the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have two intermediaries there will be three levels of markup。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manufacturer to the distributor， distributor to the retailer， retailer to the
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as you lengthen the channel you're always adding an additional markup to
    the margin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're adding more people so there's more potential for conflict that's
    fairly unambiguous。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_36.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Secondly， if you look at the level of autonomy from having completely owned
    distributors to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: franchise distributors to completely independent again as people become independent
    there's more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and more conflict the conflict increases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_38.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So those two I think are fairly intuitive and fairly obvious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last one is less so until you hear the story and this is why I think it's
    interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_40.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So the researchers who looked at this issue also looked at the density of a
    channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you have a fairly low level of conflict if there's just one exclusive outlet
    per territory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course as you increase to two the conflict goes up because now I'm in competition
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that store in the territory next door he's stealing some of my customers I'm
    stealing some， of his。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However what the researchers notice is kind of interesting is the level of competition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or conflict starts to decrease when density gets really really large。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_42.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Why is that？ Well it's because there's now an attribution problem if I see my
    market shares going down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I have eight different competitors in my local area that I'm competing against
    I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't really know which one of those guys is taking my market share so paradoxically
    when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_44.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: you have more density of retailers in a given location sometimes the overall
    conflict can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: go down。 Okay the last little task I'd like you all to think about as you're
    working through this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: material and you're thinking about what it means both how channels get created
    in terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of who is doing what the hybrid grid the other elements of design like intensive
    versus exclusive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: versus selective distribution and finally this whole area of minimizing conflict
    I think to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bring it all together would be good to have an exercise to kind of percolate
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_48.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What I'd like you to do is to try and think about a company that really innovated
    in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: area of distribution either they took over some existing activity they eliminated
    activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they turned hard good into a soft good they completely changed the way customers
    procured。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/92ee90577580415f731d6b547a214c3d_50.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the product and in so doing really developed an advantage over their competitors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So try and think about that because I think a lot of the really interesting
    innovations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are going to occur in markets are going to be innovations around the area
    of distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and access to products and services particularly as I've said many times but
    it bears repeating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that there's about a billion of us running around on the planet it'll be more
    than that。
  prefs: []

    things distributed。
