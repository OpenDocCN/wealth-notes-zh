    a performer you were by the color。
  prefs: []

    see a lot of legislation coming。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    doesn't discriminate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: against people。 There's pretty good evidence that there is something certainly
    to performance appraisals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They do something that's work。 It's not completely biased。 There's a lot of
    bias in it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's really unpopular。 Let's talk a little bit about why it's so unpopular，
    particularly now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think the reason is we've asked it to do a lot of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past when it was first started there were three things performance appraisals
    were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: supposed to do， supposed to assess your past performance and reward you for
    it， sort of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the incentive model a little bit。 It was supposed to help you get better at
    your current job and improve your performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    get better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the 1950s the big focus was on the planning your development part and they
    weren't paying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much attention to your performance at all。 But over time that started to shift
    toward assessing performance and we started to see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: again you can look in textbooks now a model of performance management which
    is pretty mechanical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Company sets goals， the goals cascade down to the departments which then move
    to the individuals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this year which fit into the company's goals for this year then we move
    toward models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    assess you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just on your overall performance but the extent to which you manifest certain
    competencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or skills。 And lots of complex scales and forced rankings which are kind of
    a tournament based system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in order to try to force distributions of people all in the goal of trying to
    do more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to assess your past performance。 There's a lot of reasons why this doesn't work
    very well and you can look down the list。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the slide here and you can see the gap between something you did and what
    the supervisor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tells you about it， concludes about it。 At the end of the year it's kind of
    like that game of telephone where information is passed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around lots of different people。 In this case there's a big time delay especially
    if the performance exercise is the end of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the year。 It's pretty difficult for a supervisor to remember everything you
    did accurately and let。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: alone to give you feedback about that。 The reason people dislike performance
    appraisals so much is because it creates conflict or you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might say it just brings to the surface a pretty obvious conflict and here's
    the conflict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see this is a bell shaped distribution， a normal distribution and if
    this is performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're talking about the average employee by definition is in the middle， the
    50th percentile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: zero in this case on the scale on the x axis。 What is the average employee believe
    they are？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The average employee believes they are in the 80th percentile so the average
    employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: believes they're well above average。 Why is that？ It's a bias called the overconfidence
    bias and particularly where we don't know much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about what we're doing we are way over confident about how well we are doing
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who are given in a laboratory context a task to perform where it looks
    like they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got a 50% chance of doing it well or winning if it's a game they believe their
    odds of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: winning are 75% right。 We're systematically over confident and we're more over
    confident about the things we know。

- en: the least about。 So you're a supervisor and you see me after a year and you
    say you call me in and I'm an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: average performer and you tell me you're doing fine， pretty okay， you're an
    average performer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I think I'm in the 80th percentile。 What happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well cognitive dissonance in my head and I'm not happy about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not happy about the fact that you believe I'm average when I think I'm above
    average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it's easier for me to just blame you for this than it is for me to maybe
    adjust my。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: view of myself。 So I'm angry at you for the next year right。 So supervisors
    don't like to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The employees often believe they're going to be told something that they don't
    like to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hear and so these conversations don't go well。 Nobody wants to do them which
    is why human resource departments have to bang on people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to get performance appraisals done in the first place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the unfortunate and uncomfortable nature of performance appraisals and
    it's also worth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: noting that supervisors are not always completely accurate about their assessments
    of people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a bunch of biases that we know affect performance scores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f234bca89164d387fe8860e9bbfa28bb_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Maybe the most important is something called the fundamental attribution error
    and this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a bias that we have when we look at human behavior to assume that the behavior
    is the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: result of dispositions。 If somebody does something bad it's because they're
    a bad person rather than the circumstances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So classic story about this， if you're driving at home in traffic at night and
    everything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is stop and go and somebody comes zip and buy you on the shoulder of the road，
    what's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your first reaction？ I bet you think， oh that guy's a jerk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rather than think she's probably on the way to the， hospital it's an emergency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We never imagined that it could be circumstance。 We're inclined to write that
    person off because of what they're doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attribute their bad， behavior， apparently bad behavior to who they are as a
    person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the performance appraisal context this means supervisors are kind of inclined
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: write off poor performance by saying it's the result of the person they're a
    bad performer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and as a result they tend not to manage them carefully anymore and kind of blow
    them away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a second aspect of bias which is just as important is self-fulfilling prophecies
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that means if we've got an employee coming into our workplace who we believe
    is a very， good worker。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people tell say great things about them， we tend to manage them differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We give them more opportunities， we don't settle for poor performance from them，
    we push。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them harder to improve their performance。 If we think they're good worker coming
    in we manage them in ways that make them better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the opposite is also true if we get somebody in who we think is not so great，
    somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who we don't think cleared the hurdle for hiring by much， somebody says bad
    things about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them when they come in。 We don't manage them the same way。 We're more tolerant
    of poor performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't push them as hard， maybe we think， they're not capable of as much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't give them opportunities to shine， we don't devote。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as much attention to them and they don't perform as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the supervisor is causing the performance differences here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we also know there's a lot of biases related to relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We give better scores to people who are more like us， we give better scores
    to people who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are physically more attractive， etc。 So the supervisors are not perfect at assessing
    employees at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is another part of， the problem。 So we see a model emerging which again
    is very different than what you might see in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: contemporary textbooks。 About a third of companies are moving in the direction
    of they're already there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is， US companies anyway， toward a model which gets rid of formal appraisals
    altogether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The end of the year there's no sit down， there's no form to fill out， there's
    no score。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What they've got instead is a model where you and your supervisor are having
    conversations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: frequently like all the time about how things are going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they're doing this in part because the model of accountability is just not
    that important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is holding people accountable for how things performed last year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Partly because they're recognizing the incentive model doesn't work all that
    well， especially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a period that we've been in for decades now where merit pay increases are
    pretty small。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a couple of percent。 So how many hoops you're going to jump through for an increase
    which is not going to be that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much different than you would have gotten anyway， at least in terms of dollar
    amounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And also I think a lot of companies are recognizing that the annual business
    cycle doesn't make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sense anymore。 They don't have annual business plans that matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can't cascade down to individual， goals from those plans and so forth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That a conversational model is much more flexible and helps people talk because
    the conversation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is all the time， not just into the year， about things when they happen and how
    to fix them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f234bca89164d387fe8860e9bbfa28bb_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now it's an interesting bet as to how this is going to play out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f234bca89164d387fe8860e9bbfa28bb_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It's a bet the companies are making， there's a lot of big companies in this，
    Microsoft， IBM， GE。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are betting that they can through organization culture get managers to
    lead these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f234bca89164d387fe8860e9bbfa28bb_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: conversations with subordinates and do them all the time in a way that a rule
    we used to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have at the end of the year， one conversation， one scale， one assessment didn't
    seem to help， us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it would be interesting to watch how this plays out but for a lot of firms
    and particularly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of leading firms， they've given up on the performance appraisal model
    altogether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f234bca89164d387fe8860e9bbfa28bb_16.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This alternative model of check-ins but also the model of regular performance
    appraisals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: involves giving feedback and that means the supervisors got to give the employees
    feedback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about how they're doing， try to get them to perform better in a way that they
    can actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take in and listen。 And a key aspect here is the idea of psychological safety
    as psychologists refer to this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might think of it as kind of common sense。 I'm not going to tell you the
    boss something that you're going to punish me for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the end of the year when you're meeting at me and we're talking about my
    performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're going to give me merit pay increase as it was after this conversation，
    you asked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: me how things went this year， I'm not going to tell you about problems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's like talking to Santa Claus， right？ Your Santa Claus is asking you if you've
    been good this year and it's going to give you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: presents afterwards。 I'm not going to tell you I was a jerk this year， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you don't get much of a conversation at that point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So can we create a context where there really is a discussion and I'm going
    to tell you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the truth that only happens if there's no consequences， bad ones for me revealing
    problems， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that means not in the context of merit pay increases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's also something called a negativity bias which is hard to get our hands
    around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that means that people really do worry about bad feedback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there's a piece of negative information about us， we disproportionately focus
    on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: seven times or more as much attention paid to a piece of negative information
    as we would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: give to an equivalent piece of positive feedback， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this means that we ought to think about how people are going to interpret
    what we， tell them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just give them straight up feedback and then let them worry about it because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we know the way they process it is going to be heavily weighted toward whatever
    negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things we say so we got to be pretty careful about how we code all that up and
    present。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f234bca89164d387fe8860e9bbfa28bb_18.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: it to them。 As a supervisor， there's probably nothing more important than giving
    employees feedback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a way of first of all helping them get better at their current job which
    is really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: important for the organization。 It is a way to help them build their career
    and for the business and particularly the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: belief in the importance of incentives， it is the way in which we let them know
    how they're， doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you're a supervisor， I would say the single most important thing to worry
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is getting better at giving people feedback in a way that they can take it in
    that doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: threaten them。 They're really listening to what you say and they're going to
    change their behavior because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of it。 So we think about all the topics around management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A couple of the biggest ones we've talked about today， motivation and managing
    performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our next edition here we're going to talk about some other more macro level
    organization。

    together into systems that fit with business。
