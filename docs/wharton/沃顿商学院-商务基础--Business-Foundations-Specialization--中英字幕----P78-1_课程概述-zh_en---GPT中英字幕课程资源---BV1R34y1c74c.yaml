- en: This is part of the Management and Leadership course。 Welcome to this program。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My name is Mike Usaim。 I'm on the faculty here at the Wharton School and I'm
    with my colleague Peter Capelli。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mike and I have both been here forever for a very long time teaching this course
    in particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to MBA students。 And there's a long history of this topic at the Wharton School
    which isn't particularly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well known。 Begins back in about 1915 with the rise of scientific management
    in Frederick Taylor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who was a lecturer here at Wharton School。 Elton Mayo was actually on the faculty
    here and created the human relations movement which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recognized that kind of people mattered。 And in the 1980s the Tabestock Institute
    was here which was an institution that was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: devoted to the idea that how you structured work and the relationships between
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at work affected the performance as well。 And here's why we've got this in this
    topic of human and social capital in the broader。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: context of a course on management and leadership。 Got to know where we're going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's call that strategy。 We got to get there and to get there we need a whole
    bunch of factors falling into place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: including the right people who are incentivized to get the job done， understand
    where we're， going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course part of this course as well is thinking about doing that across
    boundaries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And to put another sort of theme in front of us here in Peter's view and my
    view， he really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got to get this people factor right。 And to get it right it means how we manage
    people， how we hire。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how we promote， how we， reward。 All that has to be aligned with the other functions
    that any manager has to be concerned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about from finance and accounting to marketing and operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On top of that we've got to get all these pieces together and aligned in the
    same direction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So another reason to think about this as being important is this is where all
    the money is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you look in a typical business two thirds of the costs I'll go to labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also where all the discretion is particularly discretionary effort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So employees who are really bad will completely sink an organization。 It's not
    just fraud。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes it's actually internal vandalism。 And employees who are really committed
    and will work hard make organizations succeed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even when a lot of other things are going wrong。 So it is the key factor for
    differentiating what makes organizations succeed and fail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact Peter， a colleague of ours at another institution wrote a book a couple
    years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the great title of people as the ultimate competitive advantage。 Gotta
    have a strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gotta make a sustainable advantage with that。 But people separately manage for
    better or for worse do make a difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Peter I think to reference how we're gonna approach these topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's take a brief dive into Walmart and my personal guess is most listeners
    and most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: viewers have walked into at least one Walmart store and just to review a couple
    facts about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Walmart， it's an amazing organization， it goes back to 1962， today it's got
    over 11，000 stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The market value， today's stock price times the number of shares out there is
    over $200， billion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sales now this past year， very close to $500 billion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in particular for our purposes what's notable is that Walmart with over
    2 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: employees is unequivocally the world's largest employer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know also one of the most important companies in the United States， something
    like one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in five pieces of clothing are sold through Walmart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have a huge impact on the supply chain and have pioneered a lot of work
    in supply， chains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the reasons for thinking about them is they have as we say a big footprint，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean no matter what they do it has a lot of effect on a lot of people and
    a lot of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other businesses。 And since we know a lot about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: since most of us have walked into at least one store and， many people more than
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's take a look at actually two companies here。 We have Walmart in the center
    column and Costco on the right hand side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my guess is again many people have been into a Costco warehouse along the
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as we look at some numbers there， for example the annual turnover， the quit
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a close to 50% in Walmart below one in five at Costco， both are very successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Costco of course much smaller than Walmart。 But Peter at the point I like to
    make right here is that when it comes to managing people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are many ways to skin a cat。 There are good practices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many areas though there's not a single best practice。 And this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this piece of this course is going to be looking for some of the better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: practices on people management。 So I think the other reason for thinking about
    these two is something we didn't mention yet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is managing people matters a lot because it affects the lives of the
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's not just about whether organizations are going to make more money， it's
    what happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the people who work there。 And this particular comparison of Costco and Walmart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you're outside the US you may， not have seen a Costco。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're a big warehouse type retailer but they sell the same sort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of stuff generally as Walmart sells。 The fact is that they choose different
    directions matters a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe to the way the companies， compete but also to the employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Walmart has received a fair amount of criticism， partly because it is so
    big for not paying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their employees more and high turnover， etc。 And Costco is often thought to
    be the kind of opposite model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see here the differences in the rates of pay that employees at Costco
    stay longer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pay a whole lot more money， get employee benefits， more benefits， all those
    sorts of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the point here is partly there are things that we know that absolutely work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some best practices but there are also choices among best practices
    based in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: part on what you want your business to do， how do you want it to compete in
    the product， market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is， as Mike was saying before， the fact that these things have to line
    up。 Peter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why don't we break our itinerary that we are going to get in there to pursue
    more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generally not just with Walmart and Costco but with a number of enterprises。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's divide it around four issues and we see those on a slide here in front
    of us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first being how do we motivate people to come to work and get the job done？
    How do we pay them？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we promote them？ And let me just throw that as actually a question to
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you see the Walmart or Costco for that matter or any company really？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does it take just in general to get people to perform individually when
    it comes to a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reward system， a pay for performance kind of deal？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know I think this is a really important issue around the topic of managing
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it reflects some fundamental underpinnings that are important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most people understand the idea of incentives。 In the back of their mind as
    John Maynard Keynes said a lot of people are actually the slaves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of who think they are being practical， the slaves of dead philosophers， dead
    thinkers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They got in the back of their mind a model of human behavior which is a pretty
    simple， model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People are completely rational， they are incentivized by money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know from the field of psychology that a lot of that is not true and a lot
    of other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things matter besides simply money and if you want to be good at managing people
    you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to understand that。 So this is a point where it is often hard for some people
    to get their hands around if you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: haven't had a lot of psychology classes before。 A lot of people interested in
    business know a lot about finance and accounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They think that way but to get good at managing the people's part and thinking
    particularly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about these issues of how we motivate people we have to understand how people
    actually behave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are not widgets， they are not pieces of machinery and they respond in slightly
    quirky。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways and to design the right reward and incentive systems and to motivate people
    you have to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have some pretty good understanding of the you might think of it as the quirkiness
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fundamental attributes of humans。 And Peter have often heard a phrase applied
    to reward systems and that is for any organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a bit of a long march。 We put out their assistance to pay for people for
    getting the job done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out because people are not completely predictable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We incentivize here and something untoward happens over here so we revise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think it's one way to think about reward systems is to think about we
    got to have something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out there but what we have may not be fully effective completely aligning people
    in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right direction and of course people change over time as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And very nice analogy to China there Mike with the long march and the Chairman
    Mao's， long march。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mike and I have been working on a book about China and addressing some of these
    questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in China as well。 And by the way just a brief reference on that the world's
    largest employer unequivocally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is Walmart the second largest employer is a company whose popular name is Foxconn
    which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is technically based in Taiwan but it has over a million employees。 Walmart
    is a 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2 million but Foxconn has a million 1。1 million people working for it in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: China today making our iPhones for example。 So anyway these are big enterprises
    they've thought a lot about how to get the reward system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right so Peter let me go on to number two briefly here once we've got it kind
    of figured。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out at least for the moment how to hire people how to reward them for their
    individual job， done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think it's also true that the nature of the work can again add additional
    motivating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: force or rather discouraging unforce if it's not done right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think you know this is one of these topics where many people believe you
    just do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean jobs just sort of somehow fall out in terms of what it is that people
    do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is actually a lot of choices involved in this a lot of decisions and some
    of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are objectively better than others in terms of how they motivate people right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way you design a job what you actually have people do down at the level
    of the particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: task whether they have to make decisions themselves or example or whether there's
    a supervisor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: standing over them。 These are choices and they affect human behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some best practices here but there again are also some choices that
    might fit into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different kinds of organizations depending what you want them to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don't want somebody running a nuclear power plant for example to have an
    awful lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of discretion as to how they run things but somebody who's out in the field
    dealing with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a customer you probably do。 Peter let's just take some of those ideas and think
    for a moment about how you would apply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them if you are the manager of a Walmart store。 We've got a lot of people coming
    into work at 9 o'clock in the morning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He wants them to serve customers to restock shelves to do an efficient checkout
    and just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking very briefly since the compensation the wages of Walmart employees
    not terribly， high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are some of the job let's call a job design factors that might help people
    really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to do a better job on the work say on the floor of a Walmart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And for those of you who are wondering what it's like to be in business school
    this is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's known as a cold call in business school and that means you're asking
    a question you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: weren't expecting to answer but I think there's a pretty clear answer to that
    right and if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are an employee and you're not doing it for the money so much because at
    a place like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Walmart you're paid by the hour you're going to get paid whether you do the
    job or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you feel accountable for this do you feel that you are the person who are
    responsible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for this particular part of the store if for example people have a bad experience
    there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's nothing on the shelves are you the person who gets pointed to for not
    doing a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: good job with that do you have control over it。 So there are decisions you can
    make that make people feel independent of the money independent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a boss coming around telling them to do it that they want to do these things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there's some other size of that too right they may do it in their own way
    which isn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perfectly the same as what somebody in another department might do and that's
    something you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got to worry about as well。 So that's where we're going with the topic number
    one and then topic number two number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one being motivating individual performance number two working through job and
    work designs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that lead to high performance。 Our third topic going to come back to in a little
    bit is helping people at Walmart at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a store maybe nationally or anywhere make good and timely decisions and we stress
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and between good and timely we can make a snap decision we can shoot from the
    hip that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: timely but not very good or we can wait a long time to get it to be perfect
    but as we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know the phrase goes perfect is the enemy of timeliness so we want good and
    timely decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and to think about that in the context of Walmart an amazing statistic at least
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: me is that some 70% of Walmart Walmart store items are up at the cash register
    with money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coming in from a customer before the company the headquarters is actually even
    paid the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: supplier of them and of course that means they they they're seeing a lot of
    money coming。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in without having to put a lot of money out long in advance of a sale and I
    guess I'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turn the cold call on myself in this case and that is if I'm a Walmart and then
    add to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it Peter if I'm a Walmart store manager what do I want around me or maybe below
    me to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: able to make good and timely decisions and just to anticipate where we're going
    to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with that I would say two factors are pretty important one is I as a store manager
    I have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to unequivocally understand what the metrics of the performance are going to
    be what the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: intent of Walmart the parent is sending in my direction and then I don't want
    to be told。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how to do it it's got to be within the law by within the ethical principles
    of the firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you've got to give me coming from headquarters now a lot of discretion to
    get that job done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I've got that I can make good and timely decisions you know what are the
    things that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've learned at stores like Walmart is that one of the key issues which really
    can only。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be solved by the employees right up there at front is do they keep the shelves
    stocked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: yeah right because we know when customers go by and they don't see what they
    want they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just leave they don't buy it right and figuring out how to keep those shelves
    stocked is something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you can't really do by computer and algorithm at least not yet somebody's
    got to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: walk by and see we're out of this if they have to go file a report which then
    goes to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: somebody else by the time they get around to doing it it's too late the customers
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all gone so figuring out how to get employees incentivized to make those kinds
    of decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on their own is part of that story as well right so Peter good illustration
    thus of our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: third topic and that is bringing that issue of good and how many decisions down
    to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: floor of the place we work there are a number of very specific ideas that we're
    actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to be going through as part of this course so stay tuned on that as well
    a fourth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and final topic very important equally important is to then put all the people
    all the functions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the floors based together in a broader we tend to call it an architecture
    or organizational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: design to get more academic on that and we also have to be good at changing
    that organizational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: scheme as customers change as products change that are coming into the store
    so our fourth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and final topic here is designing and changing an organization's architecture
    and just by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way of brief illustration here again thinking about it safe from the standpoint
    of a store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the store manager a local location I think while the people who are in the
    financial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: side of the operation here at the store let's say outside of Philadelphia were
    relocated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they report up to the chief financial officer for the headquarters down in Arkansas
    yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's true but I also want as part of the architecture I want a direct line
    that goes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from me to them so when it comes to hiring to promoting them evaluating their
    work as part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the architecture I want that person not only to report to the chief financial
    officer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the firm as a whole but also to come by my office and let's have a very
    tangible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discussion which I can influence as Mike's describing a matrix system of management
    if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you've heard about that we're going to talk about those sorts of systems as
    well how do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you organize the chart some people might say it's also important on these to
    recognize that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organizing the chart the formal structures are also not the only thing that
    matters so。
  prefs: []
