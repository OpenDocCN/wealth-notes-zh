    is among professionals。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    written。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by two of my colleagues here at the Wharton School and also one of their colleagues
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this kind of diagram from the very first thing that。
  prefs: []

    that YouTube。

    So what the firm。

    hat of， a doctor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If he starts prescribing a certain drug to his patients， maybe I'm going to
    follow along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are influential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: for targeting purposes。 So what the colleagues did is they used the methodology
    very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very similar to what I showed， you earlier。 Remember we had the four zip codes
    Z1， Z2， Z3， Z4。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case it's the same idea but instead of zip codes they're doctors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they looked at which doctors were connected to whom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the first piece of information and then secondly which doctors had already
    prescribed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the drug and which doctors had yet to do so。 So remember when we study contagion
    processes we need to know two things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Who's connected to whom and who's done what up until the current point in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now they found a couple of really interesting things let me give you the highlights。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They measured influence and contagion in two very different ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way was to just ask people on a self-reported basis， "Hey are you influential？"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On a scale of one to ten。 And it turns out if people say they're influential
    it's not too bad but it's actually a relatively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: weak predictor compared to an indirect measure of measuring influence which
    is whether or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not I'm citing Chris's work as a doctor。 I'm referring to his scientific study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So instead of looking at a measure of influence that is self-reported what they
    did is they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: had another measure of influence that was in some sense more objective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Were doctors referring to each other's work and each other's scientific studies
    and they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: found the second one was more important in predicting the way these drugs were
    going to， diffuse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now let me give you the main takeaways from the study which I think was really
    really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fascinating。 So first of all the firm found it was really helpful for them to
    try and understand the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: network structure of their customers in this case the doctors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And also in understanding this network structure they were able to identify
    that it could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be a contagion process was at work and the contagion process was driven by these
    influential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now what's really interesting about this is some of the interests the influential
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: weren't necessarily the people who put their hands up and said hey I'm influential
    but they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were the people that they figured out indirectly were influential that is the
    doctors to whom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: others referred in terms of scientific studies and citations and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are also some quite special people who had their feet in different
    camps as it， were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the study they found that there were certain Asian American doctors who
    both were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influential for other Asian Americans but also for people outside of that ethnic
    group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_16.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: as well。 So very very interesting it tells us that understanding the network
    structure is important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Number two that contagion occurs through the network and number three in all
    networks there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are certain special people who are more influential than others and our job
    as marketers is to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_18.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: try and understand who those are。 So now let's turn to our fourth and final
    study so we've just finished a study of physicians。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the real world we've looked at some other things in the virtual world and
    now we're going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to go back to the virtual world again but with a real world twist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_20.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The company that we looked at in this case is a company called Benobo's has
    been around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: since about 2007。 Selling means clothing online also selling through traditional
    retailers and I think I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mentioned them a little bit earlier in the piece as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this resulted in a paper that my colleague and friend Jay Young and I wrote
    about something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: called neighborhood social capital and online sales so let's look in and see
    what that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking about。 So now I'm just showing you a screenshot of the company Benobo
    so you can see that they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: selling to men the target is male's age roughly 20 to 45 who are somewhat fashioned
    forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and looking for affordable fashionable clothing。 So what we wanted to do in
    this case is we wanted to try and understand whether or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there was real world interaction that was increasing the virtual world sales
    of this， company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I mean by that is that my friend Chris and I， so Chris is back in the
    picture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this time he's just a regular friend who wants a pair of pants。 He's not a doctor
    anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Chris and I are friends and if Chris happens to buy some items of clothing
    from Benobo's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dot com and I see him wearing them and he tells me about them is that going
    to lead me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to then increase the chance that I buy from the same website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what we wanted to look at whether or not interaction in the real world
    was going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to lead to additional sales in the virtual world or at the website of the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was the first piece。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now the second piece again here it's on the slide we wanted to see whether or
    not there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was an effect of something called social capital。 Social capital is a really
    fascinating concept and it's one that was really coined I believe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by a fellow at the Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government， a gentleman
    by the name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of Robert Putnam who wrote a book called Bowling Alone。 Think of Bowling Tenpin，
    Bowling in America。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The metaphor is Bowling Alone that people are maybe somewhat less social than
    they used， to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe we're spending all of our time online we're disconnected from other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_26.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And so what he wanted to do is he wanted to understand in local neighbourhoods
    how connected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people were to others。 Did they participate in churches and tennis clubs and
    get together with each other and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so on。 And what he did is he did a huge survey called the social capital community
    benchmark survey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where he and his team literally went around to about 30，000 different zip codes
    within。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the United States and they asked people like my friend Chris， "Hey Chris， do
    you like your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: neighbours？ Do you trust your neighbours？ Do you interact with your neighbours？"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so some very interesting data was collected about trust and interaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So neighbourhoods with more trust and interaction and neighbourhoods that have
    higher social。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: capital we wanted to see whether in neighbourhoods with more social capital
    there would be more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_28.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: sharing， more efficient sharing of information。 Now I just want to draw your
    attention to one other thing about this particular website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three conditions related to the product that are particularly important
    for， our study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is that items of clothing like the sweater that I'm wearing have what
    are called。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: non-digital attributes。 What does that mean？ Well a non-digital attribute is
    something that's very hard to represent perfectly over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the internet。 So price is a digital attribute。 If I go to Amazon and I see a
    book is costing $20。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know it's $20。 It's easy to communicate price information over the internet
    just as it would be if it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were positioned in a store。 However， to try and communicate how this fits and
    feels is actually quite difficult。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in that case transmission of information from one customer to another in
    the real offline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_32.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: environment could be very very important。 Secondly in our study we wanted to
    focus on those customers who hadn't yet bought anything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the website。 This was going to be their first time purchase。 Why is that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well because once you've bought something from a website and you've tried on
    the sweater。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have your own judgment。 You don't necessarily need the opinion of other
    people unless it's about the overall。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fashionability。 And then finally this is a product that's socially visible so
    it might be one that actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generates a conversation。 So I might see Chris and say hey Chris。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: look very well dressed today where'd you get those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_34.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: pants and then a conversation ensues。 So I just wanted to reiterate that this
    is a product category that's a little bit different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to most of the products that we've been talking about that are being sold by
    our friends at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: QuizZ places like soap。com and diapers。com。 Those products have primarily digital
    attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no real surprise if you order some tied detergent and it shows up at
    your house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know exactly what you're going to get。 There's no problem of communicating
    that through the internet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this time we wanted to look at a business that was a little bit different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was a fashion business that had these other properties。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_36.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let me show you what the raw data look like。 These are just the sales data
    for the company over the first I think 42 months or 3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5 years， of operations。 You can see that over time the number of new customers
    coming in is going up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also see with the blue arrows that in neighborhoods where there's more
    trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and interaction the sales are higher than in neighborhoods where there's less
    trust and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interaction。 So what does this all mean？ Well Jay and I put together a statistical
    model to try and understand this in more detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_38.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And what do we find？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_40.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And the findings are here shown on the screen but let me explain what's going
    on here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We found that about the 6，000 trials that we looked at at least half of them
    were influenced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by what we call social learning meaning the evidence from the statistical analysis
    suggested。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that some of these new customers became customers because someone in their local
    neighborhood。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: told them about it。 So that's a pretty important effect half of all the sales
    of this company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly related to that we found that the customers who came later on were
    the ones that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were most influenced by the social interaction。 This ties back to some of the
    themes that we've talked about earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people who do things right in the beginning they don't usually need to rely
    so much on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the opinions of others they just like to go out and do stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people who come in later they require more social information typically
    and that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_42.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: was also confirmed in our study。 The second thing that we found that was really
    I think the most interesting finding to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was the following。 In neighborhoods where there's more trust and interaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more social capital there's， not necessarily higher sales so it's not that just
    neighborhoods with trust and interaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have people who buy more stuff but what happens is in those neighborhoods when
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gets transmitted it's more believable and it's more trustworthy and it's more
    efficient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if Chris and I live in a neighborhood where we trust each other and like
    each other a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feed tells me something I put more weight on it。 That's the result that was
    coming through here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_44.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So how could the firm or no-post。com or any firm kind of use this information？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_46.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well when we did our analysis we were a little bit restricted to only the zip
    codes where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the social capital survey measures had been collected so there were many many
    zip codes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the United States for which those measures were not collected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now earlier I think I said that Mr。 Putnam went out and he measured 30，000 zip
    codes actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just to be clear he measured 30，000 people who were living in about 1000 zip
    codes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if a firm really wanted to use this clearly only knowing about 1000 zip codes
    is not quite。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_48.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: enough。 So here's a question I want to put to you all out there and then I'll
    give you the answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you could think of a proxy that means some other variable other than the
    true measure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of social capital that would indicate that males aged roughly 20 to 45 were
    socializing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: together and had some level of social capital what might it be？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_50.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The number of hospitals per zip code， number of churches maybe， number of rugby
    clubs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: okay you're going in the right direction turned out that the number of bars
    and liquor stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: per capita was a very nice predictor of the efficient diffusion of information
    among this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e34a8556ffcd5c675c15402b5a31bbe2_52.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: group。 Why am I telling you this because I want you to be creative and to think
    a little bit expansively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you start to use these concepts and you start to think about gee how could
    I use this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    at now。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
