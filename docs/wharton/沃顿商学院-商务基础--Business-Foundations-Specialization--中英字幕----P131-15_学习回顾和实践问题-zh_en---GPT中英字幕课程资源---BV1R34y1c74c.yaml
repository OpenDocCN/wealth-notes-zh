- en: and thus the automotive industry。 I should have said this before and I'm sure
    you have noticed this by now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I use it， to a more lean operation and to the Toyota production system interchangeably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That doesn't mean that I tried to set you to your company， it simply points
    to Toyota。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: success of developing a really powerful management system。 And more on that
    in a moment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Karl Benz， you see a picture of Karl Benz here， built the first automotive，
    vehicle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Benz-Pattent Motor Vog。 Benz was a real engineer who was passionate about
    the car at that time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my hypothesis， is that he didn't care much about cycle time， idle time and line
    balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was all about making one beautiful car。 The story about Karl Benz wouldn't
    be complete without talking about his wife。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Berta。 Berta was actually the first driver。 She drove from Manheim， where I
    went to college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    gas on the way and for obvious reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there weren't， any gas stations to refuel。 So smart as Berta was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she went into the local pharmacy to get enough fuel to get back home， to Manheim。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second part of the automotive story I want to share is about Henry Ford。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Karl Benz was a master of the product， I would say Henry Ford was a master
    of the， process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He had his epiphany for how to organize car production from visiting slaughterhouses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And slaughterhouses meet his hanging from conveyor belts and has moved from
    one worker。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the other。 So good old Henry had the idea that something like that based
    on a moving line should work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in an assembly operation。 So Ford really perfected in a very Tayloristic mindset
    the production of cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He managed to bring the time that it took to build a car down from 12 hours
    to 2。5 hours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every light heavily on specialization， each worker would only be doing a very
    small job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like 60 seconds and less of work per car which allowed Ford to take cheap immigrant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: labor off the streets and take them to quickly build up his production capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so already 100 years ago Ford was making well over a million vehicles per
    year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most famous vehicle was a model T of which he had built 10 million units
    by 1924。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was really playing a game of scale economies。 As Ford increased production
    he was going down the learning curve and was squeezing the cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the waste out of the system that made the car affordable for the American
    middle class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which led to a period of prosperity and widespread adoption of the automotive
    vehicle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Toyota story is very different。 Toyota was initially a company making automated
    looms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They went into the automotive industry just prior to World War II。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 1937 they founded Toyota Motor Company。 And as we know there was a very difficult
    time for world history。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We the Germans joined by the Japanese started World War II。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the war after 1945 the world lay in roots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And just like the US through the Marshall Plan helped rebuild the German economy
    the US tried。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to help the Japanese economy。 And that helped included the attempt to establish
    an automotive industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what the American citizens took tools and experts from Detroit and transplanted
    them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over to Japan including to Toyota。 But they didn't go very well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the reasons why this didn't work was that post World War II Japan
    had little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: domestic purchasing power。 They transcended into not having the demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the scale that was so characteristic for the， US market before。 That spelt problems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example in 1950 Toyota made a grand total of 300 vehicles。 They almost went
    bankrupt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Big prices， worker strikes。 It was really in that period of distress that the
    folks came together heavily involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/5a7d7bfd7b8b43ded7b211476883367b_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And they started building what we now refer to as a Toyota production system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I reviewed the Toyota production system in a moment but to give you a sense
    of the impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that the Toyota production system had on industry considered one last piece
    of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 1986 there was a big report published out of MIT from an institute called
    the International。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Motor Vehicle Program。 A group of researchers went around the world benchmarking
    automotive plants comparing their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: productivity levels。 You see here the type of metrics that we discuss in this
    course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gross assembly hours per car for example。 I think of as labor content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the time a GM plant would have 40 hours of labor in a vehicle， a Toyota plant
    would have， 18。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Defects 130 to 45。 Most extreme inventories。 Remember how we talked about days
    of supply and inventory turns？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two weeks worth of parts in a GM plant？ Two hours at Toyota。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That meant that Toyota would turn the inventory multiple times in a day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that was really the time when the world realized wow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is just a smarter way of building a car。 The lead author of this research
    study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a gentleman by the name of Jim Wumec， coined， then the term lean operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again lean and Toyota have since emerged as synonyms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have not done any automotive work in the United States but I did research
    with a German。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a French car manufacturer and both of those willingly admitted that they
    had embraced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Toyota production system。 So what is the Toyota production system？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many ways to visualize this but I think the most common form of summarizing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and synthesizing the Toyota production system is in the shape of a house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a roof and at the top of the roof is the idea of zero waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cool thing with the Toyota production system is you can impress people at
    cocktail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: parties with 5 or 6 words of Japanese。 So the Japanese term for waste is "muda"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So zero waste is the top goal。 Second waste people often times refer to four
    other zeros。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: zero defects， zero breakdowns， zero inventory and zero setup times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very much in the spirit of the seven sources of waste that we have discussed
    earlier on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in this module。 And then the main part of the house consists of two big pieces。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a flowpiece and there is a quality piece。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flowpiece is all about matching supply with demand and avoiding inventory
    by delivering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just in time。 This includes things such as mixed model production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flows piece at the rate of demand。 Remember we talked about tech time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we talked about single units flow， we talked about push， and pull and we talked
    about come back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again lots of things that are really popping up throughout this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are really all about the idea of flow。 And then there is a piece about
    quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quality management has many elements to it。 One big idea is really making sure
    that you catch defects as quickly as you can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when we talk about quality in the quality module of this course， we'll go
    back to this， idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we will see to your work as I empower to stop the line whenever there is
    a problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by pulling something that we will refer to as the unknown core。 Finally the
    house has a foundation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on which book you read or which expert you ask the foundations vary
    a little， bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like to think about flexibility， standardization of work and work involvement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Work and work involvement includes a famous idea of Kaizen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mentioned in passing earlier on in this module， the eighth source of waste，
    the intellect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the workforce should not be wasted。 And so Kaizen is all about involving
    the workforce in quality improvement circles and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: continuous improvement efforts。 Standardization of work is related to many of
    the seven sources of waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We make sure to standardize the one best way as opposed to having unnecessary
    motions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then really this idea of flexibility。 The ability that I can change over
    a machine from one type of car to another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or I have a worker who is trained to do multiple things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This allows me to use a worker for multiple things， which makes it easier to
    balance the， line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， I know I'm out of time for this video as I did not manage to balance video
    duration， as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me quickly summarize the learning objectives for this module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see here the definitions related to the Toyota production system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are really two simple formulas， the OEE and the flow time efficiency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a moment to practice those， one practice problem for each of those
    two formulas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take a look at this first practice problem here about the cyclist and the wind
    tunnel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Put me on hold until you've figured out the solution and then press play again。
    Alright， here we go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we start by writing down the definition of the OEE。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The OEE is simply the value at time and we're going to divide this by the total
    time over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the total time we pay the resource。 I suggest we're going to use a 10 day window
    here for reasons that will become clear in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just a moment。 So 10 days and 10 days they are 24 hours in a day and 16 minutes
    in an hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here in the denominator we have the total number of minutes over those 10
    days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we have to look at when does work not happen， right？ What do we have to
    take out？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From these 10 days they were only 9 days that we were actually working， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So 9 days when work gets done。 And then from these 120 minutes from these 2
    hours 20 minutes are not adding value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the procedures are each 100 minute long in terms of their value at time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how many procedures are we doing per day？ Well we only have 5 value at procedures
    a day because the other two are not adding value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their form of rework。 And then type this into your calculator and you get an
    OEE of 0。3125。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alright the next problem is about the percent value at time looking now from
    the perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the flow unit。 As usual put me on hold first。 Here we go again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's tackle this problem together。 So again this problem is about the percentage
    value at time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then that ratio is the ratio of the value at time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're going to divide that value at time by the flow time， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How long the unit spans in the process。 Let's start with the flow time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the time that it takes the country to renew the passport。 That is the
    2 days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the 4 days and then down here another 3 days， another 2 days， 10 days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the printing and finally another 2 days。 We add all of this up and it's
    going to take 23 days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how much value at work it's done over those 23 days？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well we can debate a little bit about the 10 minutes that is happening at the
    clerk but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a such a small number it would not matter。 Let's give them credit for these
    10 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then there are 2 minutes for the printing though that's a grand total of
    12 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of value at time。 And you divide it by the flow time and you get 0。00 something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So matter what it is， it is a very small number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/5a7d7bfd7b8b43ded7b211476883367b_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Alright that was a long video and a long module。 I hope I did not digress too
    much into the details of the automotive industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the spirit of lean， then maybe a quick year in my closing comments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thank you for joining me in this module。 I see you soon。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
