    to be based on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some measure of outcome that is within my control。 So something about my job。
    I do this， I get that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ If you don't have that， there's really no incentive。 I can't control。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much I'm going to get from you。 Then there's no incentive for me to do a
    good job。 I might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do a good job anyway because I'm a good guy， but it's not because of the incentive。
    And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the problem in lots of jobs is it's very difficult to measure my output。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I work at administration， for example， I work in a team or I work in some
    context where I'm interdependent with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people or with idiosyncratic problems， it's very difficult to measure my individual
    output。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So another possibility would be to say， well， let's make the output something
    big like overall。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: firm goal or overall organization performance。 The problem with that is it's
    beyond my ability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to control that。 And the problem with doing that is that I don't feel any incentive。
    So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you give me， for example， stock options and I work in a huge corporation，
    I've got。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: almost zero input into what happens to the share prices。 So I don't really have
    any incentive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There may be other reasons for me to have incentives。 It makes me feel part
    of the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's not the incentive from those rewards that is making me perform a particular
    way。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how about having that organizational goal anyway？ Well， the other problem with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: having goals that are maybe within my control and are pretty， even if they're
    pretty far， up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that it's possible for me to do well at my goal at the expense of the overall
    business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， if I'm a salesperson and you say， we want you to sell more stuff，
    I could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sell a lot of stuff by giving customers a really sweet deal， that's giving them
    low， prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could sell a lot of stuff and drive my performance up and my incentive pay
    up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the problem with that is sub optimization。 I'm doing well at my goal， but
    it's at the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expense of the overall business。 So it's another example of rewarding A while
    hoping for B。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the best solution about most incentive-based pay is to not rely on it too
    much and to have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that heads。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the one exception we see for incentive-based pay is at the executive level for
    people whose。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and you might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    make sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    share price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or overall performance， the agency's performance。 But even here you could get
    sub optimization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We get executives for example whose incentive pay is based on relatively short-term
    performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then there's a concern that they are driving up the short-term performance
    of the firm at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    So it's really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    simply manage。

    of economists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The incentive story。 We want somebody to behave a particular way。 Let's pay
    them if they achieve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that。 Well the psychologist added a wrinkle to this which they call expectancy
    theory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7483500670047d0b868e591276c84538_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Psychologists have a way of calling whatever they do theory and so you'll hear
    that a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through this program。 Expectancy theory basically means well what do I actually
    expect from the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: employer？ And that might be this if I have got this incentive base plan but
    I don't trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that if I actually get the performance that I will really get the reward then
    my motivation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: falls to zero。 So it's important to have predictability and trust in these models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can't just hand， somebody a contract and expect that that's going to make
    it work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you believe that， something might happen change in ownership， change
    in goals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: change in compensation structure， then your motivation erodes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another complication created by a different set of psychologists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this one particularly by our former Wharton colleague Bob House， is something
    called path。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goal theory。 And path goal theory says you could have all the incentives in
    the world and you could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even have a clear goal for people that's unambiguous。 But if they don't know
    how to get there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the incentives aren't going to do you any good。 So for example if you ask me
    to do something at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work that's kind of complicated， solve some particular algorithm or something
    and here's the。
  prefs: []

- en: reward I get if I do it but I don't know how to do that kind of math， all the
    motivation in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: world is not going to matter much。 So it reminds us of the importance of people
    having the skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: having the training， understanding what to do。 It's not just about incentives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third issue which is where we depart from the economist's soul together
    begins with a series of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we might call cognitive models that have to do with the way your brain
    processes information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    bonus right there。

    this way。 I start。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to anticipate that maybe I will get more bonuses if I continue to act that way。
    But the beauty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    time。 In fact some of。
  prefs: []

    way from this。

    randomly for doing。
