  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're not going to start at the strategic level， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to go a little bit further down into the implementation and tactical
    level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And talk again about the way the consumers perceive your brand messaging and
    marketing。

- en: So let's first start out with what are perceptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perceptions is probably one of the most important aspects in consumer behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in an understanding consumer behavior。 What is a perception？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The perception is the process of developing an interpretation of a stimulus。
    Or in other words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deciding exactly what the stimulus means。 This is really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really an important crucial area in consumer behavior for two reasons。 First。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whatever customers perceive is what affects their subsequent actions and， behavior。
    And second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is what's interesting， what they perceive is not necessarily what's
    true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Why is that？ Well， the process of perception is constructive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People construct their interpretations on the fly。 And this process is inherently
    biased。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It contains， the process of perception comes in several different stages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first two stages are the stages of attention and exposure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you can form any kind of perception， you need to be exposed to the stimuli。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you need to pay attention to that stimuli。 Pay attention to what's salient
    to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we know that that process is very biased。 You only expose yourself to things。
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's sometimes there's accidental exposure， but when you're consciously exposing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: yourself to things。 Many times it's a function of what you believe， what your
    prior beliefs are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Let me give you an example。 Say you think that a part of town is not safe。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you won't go to that part of town。 You'll stay away from that part of town。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you won't expose yourself to something you don't think is safe。 As a result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you never have ability to change your perception of that area of town because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you don't collect new data。 So we know that exposure can be selective。 Similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even if you are exposed to something， if you don't pay attention to it， again，
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can affect your perceptions。 And we know that there's two kinds of attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's voluntary attention and involuntary attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So involuntary attention is something like big bang， and you pay attention to
    it regardless。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: of whether you had intended to。 But for voluntary attention， that again is selective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have the possibility of selective exposure and selective attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means you're not collecting data on things that might be able to change
    your perception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the first stage of bias。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The second stage of bias is once you are exposed to something and pay attention
    to it， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you have to interpret it。 And we know that you interpret data subject to
    what you already believe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， most people know if you watch a presidential debate， it's important
    to have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: representatives who interpret what happened in the debate from both parties
    because we， know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a priori， that interpretations are going to vary based on their prior beliefs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_16.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And that's the same thing for any kind of consumer behavior。 You're exposed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pay attention to certain stimuli， but you interpret it subject to your， prior
    expectations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result of this， perceptions are frequently biased and they don't necessarily
    represent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_18.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: what's true。 So what's the overview of the perceptual process？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are sensory inputs that the marketer puts out。 We're going to talk about
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: brand communication， there's advertising， there's packaging， all， sorts of different
    sensory inputs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you are exposed to them or you're not。 And sometimes the exposure，
    as I mentioned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is in a bias way。 And then even if you are exposed to these inputs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're exposed to thousands of marketing， cues every single day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but how many of them do you pay attention to？ So first there's the issue of
    exposure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then there's the issue of whether or not you pay， attention to it。 And finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's the issue of interpretation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_20.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Let me give you an example here。 This is a psychological test。 It's called a
    Stroop Test。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what I want to show you is that your perceptions， and I just explained to
    you your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perceptions could be biased。 But your perceptions affect your subsequent behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's almost an automatic reaction。 You have a certain perception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you automatically respond to that。 And it's very hard to control that。
    Even if you think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well， I understand that my perceptions might be biased and therefore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to try to do something to control that so I don't react inappropriately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But these perceptions are automatic things and it's very hard to block their
    effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let me just give you a little test here。 I'm going to show you several words
    on the screen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what I want you to do is tell me the color of the font。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's going to be four words and I'm going to just put them up on the screen
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to yourself tell me the color of the font。 So here are the words。 There's the
    second one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third one。 And the fourth one。 Now by the fourth one you probably got what
    was going on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean the first one maybe you were a little bit surprised and you saw that
    the word was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: blue but the color of the font was red so the answer was red。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the fourth one you understood the pattern but it was still hard to break
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You couldn't stop yourself from reading the word and reading the word affected
    your subsequent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: behavior。 It slowed you down。 That's actually the purpose of the Stroop test。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a stress manipulation。 It makes people feel a little bit uncomfortable
    because of that dissonance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I put the words up where the words match the color of the font the task is
    much simpler。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's four words where the color matches and you can see it's much easier
    much faster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to say the words。 This is the same thing in the way marketing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to show you that color has an effect。 Brand name has an effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you cannot block this effect。 It affects your subsequent perceptions and
    subsequent behavior and it's an automatic reaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's difficult to stop。 So let me just give you here's an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I told you this is Luscious Chocolate and I show you a picture of it in the
    shape of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a cow pie it's very hard to stop that first initial feeling of "Oh I don't want
    to eat， this。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That disgust feeling。 And you know that it's good chocolate but the shape has
    an involuntary effect on you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's a very important thing to understand。 So marketers need to understand
    how these things affect your perceptions and your subsequent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: behaviors because as I say these are automatic reactions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's some visual illusions you may have seen these before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can show you these two lines on the screen。 I will tell you you can measure
    them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are exactly the same length。 However， one looks longer than the other and
    you just can't stop that feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though I tell you they're exactly the same length and I can prove it to
    you you still。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have the perception that the one on top is longer。 Here's another example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here's an example of how your prior expectations influence your， perception
    of the stimulus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I ask you what is this that I put on the screen， you'll answer differently
    if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I show it to you this way versus when I show it to you this way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so that shows you what you perceive that stimulus is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a function of your prior expectations。 Here's another one that we know
    and this one I'm going to take a little bit closer to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the beginning。 There's a perception bias that's called the proximity bias。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what the proximity bias says is that things are close to each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You assume they're more similar。 So if I ask you which lines are similar to
    each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most people will say the two lines， that are clustered together are similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that they'll cluster the two lines that are close to each other rather than
    say the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two bold lines or the two thin lines because you make this inference of things
    that are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: close to each other must belong together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And you can see this in the supermarket， in stores， say in the salad section
    where there's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: vegetables marketers may put or grocers may put salad dressing near those salads。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's an implicit assumption that if the product is near another product，
    they belong， together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a perception that physical distance affects whether things are similar
    or belong， together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the mall stores that are close together are seem to be more similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's a lot of use of this particular bias。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_26.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another one is a similarity bias。 Things that look alike， people assume have
    the same quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is the underlying theory behind， say， store brands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a store brand makes itself look very similar to the national brand， you assume
    the quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the same， even though you haven't tested it， you don't know if that's the
    case， you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making an assumption of perceived quality based on this process of similarity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so these perceptual inferences are very， very strong at influencing your
    perception， of quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way you consume the product， the way you experience the product， the price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're willing to pay， et cetera。 And it's a very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very important consumer process for marketers to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's particularly important in branding。 So we know that if you take a glass
    of cola or a bottle of cola and you slap on a brand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say the Coca-Cola brand， people will have different perceptions about that product
    than。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if the brand wasn't there。 With the Coca-Cola brand on it， people will think
    it tastes better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're willing to， pay a higher price， they'll make all sorts of other inferences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even if the product's， exactly the same， once we put a brand on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it changes the perceptions of the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_28.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And people think， I'm not subject to that。 I know I can judge certain products
    by the quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not influenced by brand names。 And we know from experiment after experiment
    after experiment that that's just not true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People are very much influenced by the brand name that's put on the product
    independently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the product quality。 It's the same way in the Stroop test。 You just can't
    stop it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you see that brand name， you have certain perceptions， you make certain
    inferences about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that brand name and those perceptions are translated to the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know that brand is such a powerful brand， as we mentioned before。 It has
    so much influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Coca-Cola brand name has been estimated to be worth $70 billion， as an asset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just putting that brand name on a product will change， as I said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Price premiums people are willing to pay， the quality， et cetera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you know that that brand is worth so much， many times people look for ways
    to leverage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the brand for growth。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/c93c24c2e68f20dadf9e2099ccb7cfb4_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So for example， you know Coca-Cola is associated with the Cola soft drink。 In
    1982。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coca-Cola took that brand name and put it on a brand new product at the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that no one had tasted before， a diet soft drink。 They call it diet coke and
    automatically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even though that product was not on the market， before， people assume it has
    a better taste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a higher quality product and again they're willing to pay a higher premium
    price for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that product。 This is a brand new product but the perceptions of it are so high
    because of the brand name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's stamped on the can。
