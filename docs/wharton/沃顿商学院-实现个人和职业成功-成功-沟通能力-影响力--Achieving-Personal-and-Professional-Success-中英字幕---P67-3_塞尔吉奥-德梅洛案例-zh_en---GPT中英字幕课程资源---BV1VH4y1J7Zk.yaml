  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they commissioned judges almost straight away to start rebuilding the legal，
    institutions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I say DeMello did。 He just initiated this。 Of course he had a big team there
    helping out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DeMello was acutely sensitive to symbolism and to national self-esteem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So he took many actions to indicate that he did not consider himself above the
    people， there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that he didn't consider himself a king in some way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was very sensitive to the way he and the staff treated the locals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One example was he also studied the local language。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was fluent in Portuguese but the local language， Teddam， was something that
    he decided。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he wanted to be able to use。 And so in his off hours he was always trying to
    sneak in some extra language instruction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then he worked his tail off。 He was famous。 He was famously a hard worker
    but there he was known for working something like 19 hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: days。 And of course when the leader is working 19 hour days the staff is doing
    the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these are all his inclinations out of the box。 This is the first stage and
    this is only the early days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is like six weeks or so。 They didn't have much of a honeymoon period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what they did with it。 Okay。 Phase two。 The crisis worsens。 Remember
    is they were in crisis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was nothing working in this country when they took it over because it
    had been raised。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the militia and the Indonesian military。 So things got worse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 80% unemployment they weren't making a dent in the unemployment。 The UN didn't
    have the expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out to do many of the things that they needed to do to rebuild this
    country。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As one staff member put it， staff UN staff is good at diplomatic cables not
    laying electrical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cable。 The main thing could be said basically everywhere you turn they just
    didn't have the skills to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: physically rebuild a country。 There were multiple missteps with some very important
    issues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example the guerrilla army， the army that had resisted Indonesians for
    24 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the army that had essentially provided leadership for the country for 24 years
    had to be honored。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in some way while at the same time they had to protect in other UN situations
    those kinds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of armies had been sources of problems。 So D'Mella was very reluctant to give
    them any leeway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tried to keep them very tightly， leashed and that was a real issue for them
    especially given the role they had played in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the resistance。 And then the whole effort was hampered by UN regulations that
    were highly restrictive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and many cases inappropriate。 So for example there were restrictions on what
    funds could be used。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what funds could， be used on。 So the UN staff had a huge budget。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 600 million or something like that while the budget couldn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be spent directly on the T-Mores though， the whole East Timor budget was something
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 60 million dollars。 So all these funds were flowing into the UN staff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: couldn't spill over into the real， needs in the country。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example there were 500 UN cars in East Timor and D'Mella had to work
    to get even。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 10 of those allocated to the T-Mores leader。 So you can imagine how this goes
    over with the local populace when all these new cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are coming in flooding the country and yet none of the non-UN staffers have
    access to， it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As spring 2000 rolled around and remember they just got there in November， this
    is just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a few months later they were really on the brink of failure。 Physical security
    was breaking down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was more and more threats from the militia that hadn't quite melted away
    as much as they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thought。 The economy was still in ruins and the T-Mores began viewing the UN
    as "a second occupation"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is about as big an insult as you could give given it was the UN that negotiated
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: end of the first occupation， the 24-year occupation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is the situation D'Mella finds himself in after his best efforts and
    about six months。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of work there which leads us to phase three where D'Mella really had to reset
    his priorities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and double his efforts。 In this case his highest priority was emphasizing security。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He revised the peacekeepers rules of engagement。 The peacekeepers are the UN
    military people there who were intended initially to be merely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: passive。 They didn't initiate engagements。 In fact they had to fire a warning
    shots before they fired anybody but in order to tighten。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up military security， safety of the people he allowed them to initiate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He allowed them to be more actively involved。 A couple of large police and military
    sweeps to drive out the militia and then some important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: strategic decisions like they had a repatriation office in West Timor and they
    had to shut that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: down because it was threatened people's lives were threatened out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It meant they couldn't bring people back from West Timor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: East Timorry citizens who wanted to come back they had to let that go and leave
    it there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it was too much of a security threat。 So really emphasizing security
    was his number one priority and not his inclination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He is a man who had spent his career advocating for humanitarian efforts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wasn't his inclination but he considered it the priority here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Number two he created a co-government。 So for the first time in the mission
    high paid foreigners would work directly under the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: team reese in particular he had eight secretary said department heads essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He made four of them internationals as the initial plan was but then four were
    East， Timorries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He literally allocated half of the government to East Timorries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was before the government was formed。 This was before elections that happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was before the Constitution was created all of which was against the rules。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The UN officials hated this that was not the mandate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was supposed to be running the country for two years but he recognized it
    wasn't going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to work if he ran the country。 He had to give these guys more power and it had
    to be substantive power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Couldn't be superficial power。 He gave literally half the cabinet to the team
    reese。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the folks didn't like this even local staffers。 UN staffers didn't like
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They said we came to work for the secretary general not this department head
    from the local， folks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this critical moment DeMello called a gathering all 700 UN staffers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He put those four department heads the East Timorries department heads and says
    these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: four are your new bosses。 I assume for responsibility you either obey them or
    you can leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Took a real stand with these guys。 Another wrinkle and there were lots of variations
    on this but he figured out ways to navigate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the UN bureaucracy to get more resources to the local folks and more money and
    to the， economy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example he was able to use some of his budget on road repairs because the
    logic was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the road the damage the roads are so bad they're hurting the UN vehicles。 This
    is how crazy it was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He couldn't repair the roads directly because that didn't fall within the UN
    mandate but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if the roads were bad and damaged the vehicles he could do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He found wrinkles like that as a ways of giving the locals more and pouring
    more money into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the economy。 Finally in 2001 this is you can see about nine months worth of
    effort here。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we have independence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The vague a year from now two years from now wasn't enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He laid out a clear plan that said elections in the summer write a constitution
    then decide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how to do the presidency and then we'll hand things over。 These were the steps
    he took。
  prefs: []

    he was able。
  prefs: []
