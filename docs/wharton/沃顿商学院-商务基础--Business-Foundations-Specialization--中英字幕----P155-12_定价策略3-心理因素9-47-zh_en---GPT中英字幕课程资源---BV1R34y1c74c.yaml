    the following scenario。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He said， "Imagine an individual that's called him Mr。 A， and Mr。 A has just
    won two tickets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in lotteries。"， It's kind of a lucky guy。 He won one ticket for $50 and another
    ticket for $75。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So he's won two separate lotteries valued at $75 together。 Mr。 B， let's call
    him Mr。 Brown。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he also is pretty lucky。 He won a ticket for $75。 So from a strictly economic
    point of view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: both of these gentlemen have had their wealth， go up by $75。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we believe that people are completely rational， then the fact that both
    of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gentlemen increased their wealth by $75， they should be equally happy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when he presented this to individuals like you and I in an experiment and
    asked us to， say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Who do we think''s happier？"， Mr。 A or Mr。 B， "We all think Mr。 A is happier。"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the reason we think that is when you get good news， like windfall gains，
    it's better。
  prefs: []

    three gifts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for Christmas。 Would you wrap them all in one big box or would you separate
    them out？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think we all know again， at least in Western culture， we'd rather separate
    them out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when news is good， you want to spread it all around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6510cfb76d0581370bde2e4eda1e75a8_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Okay， so let's continue with this example。 What about if news is bad？ So in
    this case， Mr。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A in the experiment received two unfortunate letters from two different， tax
    authorities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The federal government in the United States says， "Sorry， Mr。 A， you owe an
    extra $100。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on your taxes。"， The state of Pennsylvania also sent him a letter saying， "Sir。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you owe $50 on your taxes。"， So the poor guy has to cough up $150 to the tax
    authorities。 Now Mr。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: B also received some bad news。 He owes $150 in tax， but only to the federal
    government。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have two individuals who've both been given the same negative information。
    They have to pay $150。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But because， again， Mr。 A has received two negative hits， people like you and
    I in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6510cfb76d0581370bde2e4eda1e75a8_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: experiment think that Mr。 A is going to be less happy。 So this is exactly the
    opposite inference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you've got bad news， you should lump it all together。 Good news should
    be separated around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what does this mean for pricing？ Well， imagine that your company and your
    charging customers a lot of different things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: three， or four different things。 You might be better off trying to give that
    price information just as one overall price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rather than itemizing the entire thing。 And again， if we think back to the financial
    crisis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there was an interesting example of， this on a large scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might remember that the federal government in the United States bailed out
    various banks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on to the tune of about $750 billion。 That's a lot of negative information。
    That's a big hit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I think people became especially annoyed about this when they saw that $50
    billion was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to bank $100 billion to this bank。 And so listing things that are negative
    creates a disproportionate negative effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you've got bad news， what you should do is you should integrate it all
    together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what about if news is mixed？ This is interesting things for pricing。 So
    again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imagine my friend Amy here at the Wharton School。 She likes to come to school
    by bike。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And even though crime never happens in Philadelphia for the sake of argument，
    let's imagine that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it does， and poor Amy's bike is stolen。 It's going to cost her $180 to replace
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chris as well again， perhaps it's the same thief who knows。 He has a bike， slightly
    better bike。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a $200 bike。 His bike is also stolen。 But Chris， on the way to get his lunch
    in the cafe and Huntsman Hall。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he notices on the， ground a $20 bill。 So Amy is out $180。 Chris is out $200
    but he found $20。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But he's also out $180。 Well， who's happier？ It turns out that Chris is actually
    happier because of something called the silver lining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: principle。 Yeah， he got negative $200 but the plus $20 sort of makes him feel
    better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how will we translate this into pricing？ Well， if I'm trying to sell you
    a car for $20，000。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instead of charging you $20，000， I， might be better off charging you $22。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 but let me give you a $2，000 rebate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6510cfb76d0581370bde2e4eda1e75a8_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So I'm sure you can see how that principle kind of works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now I'm just going to spend a couple of minutes introducing a very， very
    important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: psychological theory called prospect theory that has interesting implications
    for pricing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6510cfb76d0581370bde2e4eda1e75a8_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I'd encourage you if you're more interested in theory than just beyond what
    we're talking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about to just have a search for on Google。 So prospect theory was developed
    by two psychologists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first of whom is Professor Daniel Kahneman who still teaches at Princeton
    University and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has written a number of other influential things in the area of human psychology
    and decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making。 So the co-author was Professor Amos Tversky who unfortunately passed
    away who was a professor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at Stanford University and the two of them received the Nobel Prize for this
    idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's a pretty good idea。 Let's see how it applies to pricing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in standard economics as you might imagine， you and I are supposed to be
    indifferent between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: outcomes that have the same expected value。 What do I mean by that？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let me give you a simple example。 So let's imagine my friend Amy offers to give
    me a $100 bill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She says， "Okay David， you can have a $100 bill or you can take the following
    gamble。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the gamble is I'm going to toss a coin， a fair coin。 If the coin comes up
    heads。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to give you $200。 And if it comes up tails， I'm going to give you
    nothing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I think about that， getting $100 for sure， that's $100。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The gamble also has an expected value of $100 because 0。5 times 200 plus 0。5
    times zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is also 100。 So the expected gain I'm going to get from these two things is
    exactly the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I'm a completely rational calculating person， then I should be indifferent
    between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these two options。 But maybe you have a preference。 I would certainly have a
    preference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd take the $100 for sure。 So what Professor Kahneman and Diversky found is
    when options were offered as a sure thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that were positive options， like receiving money for example， people would
    rather have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the sure thing than the gamble， even though the expected value was the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Counter to what we would learn in traditional economics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they developed a new theory called prospect theory that has three really
    important points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to it that are missing from most other standard theories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one is that people have an internal reference point where they expect
    certain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things from a stimuli like price。 And I'll explain this with an example in a
    moment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second thing is people respond differently to deviations from the reference
    point whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're positive or whether they're negative。 And then thirdly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's something called diminishing sensitivity that's a little bit， more complex。
    I'll let you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those of you out there who are very interested in this theory to look that，
    up on your own。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But let me give an example of how it works for pricing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine I go to my local Starbucks to buy a cup of coffee and I'm expecting
    to pay a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dollar for the coffee。 That's my internal reference point。 When I get there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the coffee is selling for 75 cents。 So I've just encountered a gain or a positive
    deviation from the reference point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Paying 75 cents is better than paying a dollar。 So because of that gain of 75
    cents on the x-axis here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my happiness is going up by some， amount。 I'm happy from that gain of 75 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what's happened because of that transaction？ My reference point has now
    shifted from a dollar to 75 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's been affected by the experience that I've just had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I go back to the Starbucks a day later expecting to pay 75 cents。 But
    lo and behold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the price has gone up to a dollar。 So now what's happened from my reference
    point of 75 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've encountered a loss of， 25 cents。 The loss is the same size as the gain
    was before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the loss causes me to feel very， very unhappy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a phenomenon called loss aversion that for the same deviation， 25
    cents in either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: direction。 The pain of the loss might be twice as much as the pleasure of the
    gain。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll let you go into this in more detail on your own。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the idea is if you promote your product too often， then you try to raise
    it back to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the regular price。 You've already driven somebody's reference point down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then when you raise the price back to the regular price， you're setting
    them a loss。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6510cfb76d0581370bde2e4eda1e75a8_16.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that they will react negatively to。 That's an important implication of this
    theory。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so let me summarize what we've done in this module about pricing to value。 First
    and foremost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the thing to keep in mind is the framework for inputs to the pricing， process。
    First of all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's my marginal cost？ I do not want to price below that。 That's the floor。
    Second of all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what is the customer's willingness to pay is determined by their price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the ceiling。 Thirdly， by how much will I have to reduce the price because
    of competitive pressures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And fourthly， by how much will I have to raise the final price to the consumer
    just to give。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my distributor or my partner some margin to play with， those are the four things
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: determine price。 That's the framework。 The second thing that we spent a lot
    of time on was the notion of customer price sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how it could be measured。 And then finally， pricing wouldn't be as much
    fun and wouldn't be as complicated and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as intricate without thinking about all of the aspects of human psychology that
    come into， play。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Things like prospect theory， things like mental accounting， the endowment effect，
    and so on。
