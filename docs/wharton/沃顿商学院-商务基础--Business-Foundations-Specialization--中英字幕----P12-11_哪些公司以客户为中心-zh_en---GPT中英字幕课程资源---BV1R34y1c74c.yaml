    very famous retailers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    most of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you'll appreciate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    centric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    discussion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    up to you would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    centricity means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and then I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    customer centric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I want to be careful about this。 I have great admiration for all these firms。
    I'm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a big customer of all of them。 I really like what they do。 But all of them for
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reasons fail to be truly customer centric， nearly as much as perhaps some of
    you thought。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when deciding which of these firms are， aren't customer centric。 So let me just
    take a few。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moments to talk through each one of them and then finally we'll bring up our
    definitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of customer centricity。 First there's Walmart。 Now again， Walmart is a terrific
    firm but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Walmart knows surprisingly little about any one of its customers。 Unlike Harrah's，
    unlike， Tesco。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unlike so many other retailers out there， Walmart does not have a loyalty program。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Walmart has made very little effort to date to try to figure out exactly what
    each customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is doing and how they can influence each customer's behavior。 So while Walmart
    might not make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of efforts to understand what any one customer is going to buy， they make
    great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: efforts to understand the customers as a whole。 They understand regional differences。
    They。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understand when certain kinds of events occur， for instance， when a hurricane
    is about to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hit the southeastern US， they need to fill the stores with water and batteries
    and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they understand the customer in a generic way but they make very little effort
    to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customers in a very specific， granular way as a direct marketer would suggest。
    And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know what？ That doesn't bother me because Walmart isn't intending to be
    a direct marketer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about the Walmart business model， it's about selling in great volumes。
    It's about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bringing the cost way down。 So in many ways， Walmart is a prototypical and a
    wonderfully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: successful product centric firm。 Let's come up with products that we can sell
    a whole。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lot of that's going to let us bring our costs down。 And let's figure out ways
    to extend our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product goodness and all the aspects that I mentioned for product centricity
    apply to， Walmart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in many ways， I excuse them。 I allow them to focus on product centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because they're so good at it。 There are very few firms in the world that can
    operate in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an operationally excellent manner as well as Walmart can。 It's a similar but
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: story for Apple because Apple， again， is the classic performance superiority
    firm。 They。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't spend a whole lot of time doing market research to figure out exactly
    what the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wants。 They don't spend a whole lot of time focusing on segmentation and real
    granular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: analyses to try to predict what any one customer is going to do over time。 What
    Apple focuses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on is leveraging its product expertise， is taking the kinds of products that
    they've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: already developed and figuring out what are the next ones that they should develop。
    So， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a classic example of product centricity and they do it better than most other
    companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the planet and they can get away with it。 Now， while Walmart and Apple， for
    the most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: part of focusing on doing product centric things， operational excellence for
    Walmart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: performance superiority for Apple， they are doing some smart things at the margin
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understand their customers better。 For instance， Walmart is spending a little
    bit more time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: developing technology that's not only going to help them learn about their customers，
    but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even more operationally efficient than they were before。 So for instance here
    in the， US。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have a new program they call Scan and Go， a mobile app that lets people
    scan products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as they move around the store so as they check out， the whole scanning process
    happens much， faster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a brilliant idea that lets them be more operationally excellent but also
    lets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them start tagging individual customers and tracking them over time。 So they're
    starting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to take on some more customer centric initiatives without sacrificing the operational
    excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Apple is also starting to do a number of things。 Again， small initiatives
    not driving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the business that are letting them understand their customers a little bit better。
    Whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's tracking people's music preferences through iTunes or some of the activities
    that they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do in the Apple retail stores， slowly but surely they're starting to develop
    a better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understanding of their customers at a more granular level。 And who knows， one
    day， if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and when competition catches up and Apple can no longer be the product leader
    that they， are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they could probably turn around and start to be a great customer centric firm
    as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But today it's not quite as mission critical as it is for other firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third company on our list， Starbucks， is a very interesting contradiction。
    At a local， level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starbucks or any coffee retailer is very， very customer centric。 The barista。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the person on the other side of the counter， the person who makes your coffee
    knows a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about you if you're a regular customer。 Not only does he or she understand your
    coffee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: preferences and what other items you might buy in that store but just through
    the casual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: conversations you have with them， they might know what movies you like， what
    kind of clothing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you like to buy， something about your job， your family and they'll often make
    recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to you that are going to make your life better even if Starbucks itself isn't
    making a penny。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: off of those recommendations。 That is customer centricity。 Being a trusted advisor
    to the really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: good customers， finding ways to lock that customer in and so on。 So the paradox
    is while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starbucks is very customer centric at a local level， they're not that customer
    centric at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a national level。 You take your Starbucks loyalty card and you bring it to a
    Starbucks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in another city or another country and show it to them and say， "I'd like the
    usual please。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have no idea who you are。 It's not only can they not meet your immediate
    needs but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's hard for them to be a trusted advisor and to make other recommendations
    to you when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have no idea about anything about your history。 So to me that's a really
    key point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not enough for a company to be customer centric some of the time when they
    know who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are but a truly customer centric company will identify you and will be able
    to value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you and make recommendations no matter what kinds of interactions you have with
    them。 Whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you go from store to store， whether you go online or offline， that's what customer
    centricity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is all about。 Now Starbucks to their credit recognizes this and they're coming
    up with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all kinds of interesting technologies that are going to let them collect and
    integrate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your data across stores and across other touch points you have with them。 They
    recognize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that the opportunities and the necessity for customer centricity is at least
    as important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as it is to come up with the next great coffee flavor。 So again it's that balance
    between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: focusing on the product and focusing on the customer that so many companies
    are now struggling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with。 And finally there's Nordstrom's。 Now while that might be the least familiar
    company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/06f3c7f587ae7b30e852f49d6ac5e57a_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: on the list especially to those of you outside the US it might be the most interesting
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to help us understand what customer centricity really is and isn't。 But whether
    you've shopped。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it in Nordstrom store or not you might be familiar with the story that makes
    Nordstrom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so supposedly customer centric or not。 And here's the way it goes。 Nordstrom's
    a high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: end department store they sell clothing shoes and so on。 One thing they don't
    sell is tires。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet one day someone walked into a Nordstrom store supposedly in Fairbanks， Alaska
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wanted to return a set of tires that obviously they could not have bought at
    Nordstrom's。 Perhaps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there was a tire store at that location before Nordstrom's open shop。 And Nordstrom's
    being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so incredibly customer centric gave them the money back for tires that they
    didn't buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at Nordstrom's。 Now is that customer centricity or what？ I like to say or what？
    If you think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about it for a minute is that really customer centric or is it actually kind
    of stupid？ Does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it make sense to give someone money back for a product that they couldn't possibly
    have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bought from you？ For me I say most of the time it's probably a bad idea to do
    that。 And the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: question is under what circumstances would it be a good idea to do that？ Think
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that for a second。 When would it make sense to give someone money back for a
    product that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they couldn't have possibly bought from you？ When would it make sense？ And here's
    the answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If that customer is incredibly valuable to you and I'm talking about future
    value， I'm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking about the fact that we expect this customer to be buying so much from
    us in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: future that if we don't give them money back for the tires that they thought
    they bought， from us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if we don't give them money back today we're going to lose that value。 If that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the case we'll happily give you the money back for the tires that you didn't
    buy。 Maybe we'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: double the money back。 Who knows？ So it all depends on the value of the customer，
    the， future value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the lifetime value of the customer。 If that's sufficiently high then we'll have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a roll out the red carpet for you。 And if it's not and for most customers it
    wouldn't be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we would politely decline。 We might still be nice to you of course but
    we're not going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to give you money back if we don't see the value in it。 And that's the problem
    with Nordstroms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nordstroms offer such wonderful service。 They treat everybody so incredibly
    well regardless。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the value of that customer。 And that's the problem with Nordstroms is that
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they fail to focus on figuring out the future value of each and every customer
    they're just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to treat everybody really well。 And there's a lot to be said for that。
    It's a wonderful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company。 I like knowing that when I go in there I'm going to be treated really
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I think that they're missing some opportunities by picking and choosing
    a little bit more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the old days it was impossible to do that。 But today Nordstroms like every
    other retailer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has the capability to collect the data and use technology to do a little bit
    more targeting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a little bit more selection to figure out who is worth the extra special
    treatment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and who doesn't necessarily deserve it。 So to me the Nordstrom example is a
    great example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of where product and customer centricity collide。 And what I want to do now
    is to start focusing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more on what customer centricity really means。 And that's what we're going to
    do next。 [Music]。
