  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has very strong effects on perceptions， and it's a very interesting category。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's kind of look at packaging。 We started learning a lot about packaging
    here in the US in the 1930s。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what happened in the 1930s was that the grocery store was moving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the person behind the counter where you would go to a grocer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'd go to a butcher or bakery and you talked to somebody behind the counter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they were moving to self-service supermarkets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that the consumers were going to go up and down the aisles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the supermarket by themselves and pick out products without any help。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When this started happening， it was very clear that the packaging the product
    was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in was going to matter a lot。 And so the question was how will people use packaging
    cues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to choose what they're going to choose in a supermarket？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/55068ea6fd86954718039f8144eaada4_4.png)'

- en: And so one of the early famous experiments was done with detergent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they put the same detergent in two different boxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because what we were testing here was the differences in the packaging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in one package they had a design that had circles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in the other package they had a design that had triangles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they wanted to see which one people would choose。 And it turned out it was
    very reliable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People preferred the detergent that was in the box with circles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So then they let people take both of these detergents home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now remember the detergent in both boxes was the same。 What was different was
    the package。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the consumers took both packages home。 They much preferred the package
    with the circles on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they used the detergent from both boxes and then were asked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which detergent did you like better。 And this is what was really surprising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only did they like the package better with the circle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they believed that the detergent in the box， with the circles worked better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was astonishing at the time。 People couldn't believe it because it was
    exactly the same detergent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they redid the study a few times with larger sample sizes， and consistently
    got the same result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was the beginning of understanding， that the package absolutely influences
    the perception of the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/55068ea6fd86954718039f8144eaada4_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And now today if you look at tie for example still has those circles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on its product even when it goes in different countries， things will change
    in the package。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you will still see those circles which we know were really preferred。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by consumers for choosing the detergent。 And they're in that bright yellow that
    really pops out at you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So packaging is very interesting because it can influence， at the point of purchase。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It helps you choose what you're going to choose。 But as these experiments showed
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it continues to have an influence， at the point of consumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it not only gives you a reason to choose when you're purchasing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it also influences your perception of the product experience itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are multiple objectives in a package。 You can identify the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can present some kind of information。 The package can be used to protect
    the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be used to store the product。 It can aid in consumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can give you more information on how to use the product appropriately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the package not only using perceptual cues， the packaging not only uses a
    lot of color。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the packaging is also pretty informative。 I've talked a lot about color
    before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you have to know that packaging aesthetics are --， and the function are
    very， very critical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The colors are used to help grab consumers' attention， in a sea of competing
    messages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it also though has to be used so that you want to buy the product again
    and again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you want to choose the variations of colors and designs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that they'll make for an impactful package。 But you have to， as I mentioned
    earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know your distribution channels， because you don't necessarily control the way
    the package is ultimately distributed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are certain -- you might do some really cool things with your package。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then the retailer doesn't necessarily abide by the way you want those --。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that package is exhibited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/55068ea6fd86954718039f8144eaada4_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And that's just the reality and you have to think through that when you're doing
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me go over some iconic packages， and how they really changed customer perceptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and really helped build market share。 I've talked about color and color is extremely
    important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me say that colors on packaging can really do the same kinds of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I'm not going to be redundant and mention color again。 So let me focus now
    on shape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/55068ea6fd86954718039f8144eaada4_10.png)'

- en: So one of the new products that came out， Calvin Klein came out a number of
    years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tens of years， decades ago， I think actually， was one of the first products
    that came out with a fragrance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that was designed for both men and women。 It was unusual in that case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a lot of the ads showed -- very designy ads and they showed models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that the gender was kind of ambiguous。 And so it was a very interesting campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they really wanted the product to be seen as etching。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so if you look at this package of the CK clone that they came out with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see that edginess in the package。 The shape of the clone was in the
    shape of a flask。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is an interesting thing for a clone。 You know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not usually the shape of a product you think for a clone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can also see that they used asymmetry in their logo。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which again really gave this notion of edginess。 And a lot of times when people
    choose fragrance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is one thing we know for sure， they're not really experts at choosing different
    scents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the packaging in the brand name is very influential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in what people choose as the fragrance they like。 Another famous。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: famous shape of a bottle was absolute。 This was one of -- this campaign I don't
    think is being used anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it was used for about 10 years。 It's one of the most famous print campaigns
    around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the whole print campaign was predicated on the shape of the bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So vodka a lot of times people have difficulty telling different baccas apart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's not to say they're not different， but some people have difficulty time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially after the tenth drink。 And so the bottle really， really is important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The brand name in the bottle is establishing brand loyalty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The absolute bottle was interesting because most of spirit bottles have a longer
    neck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because bartenders or people use a product。 They hold the neck to pour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So actually this wasn't as easy a bottle to use， but it's because it was so
    distinct that the shape of the bottle was so important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/55068ea6fd86954718039f8144eaada4_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And they really， really focused on the shape of the bottle and the ads。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ads went through different stages。 Some of the ads just showed the bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the ads showed other things in that shape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like I remember a famous one where they had an LA ad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they had the swimming pool in the shape of an absolute bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they did a lot of -- they used celebrities， they used artists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they did a lot of creative things， but it was always around the shape of the
    bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/55068ea6fd86954718039f8144eaada4_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another iconic shaped bottle is Coca-Cola。 So Coca-Cola， as I mentioned， is
    a very， very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very strong brand name。 But part of that brand imagery comes not only in their
    logo。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and their red color in their famous polar bear ads and other types of ads they
    have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also in the shape of their six and a half ounce bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was their first product and it was a very distinctive shape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that people could tell it was a Coca-Cola from all the other soft drinks out
    there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the bottle went from glass to plastic， originally when Coca-Cola came out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with their plastic bottle， they lost their unique shape。 And that was a decided
    disadvantage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they managed to figure out how to recreate their iconic glass shape in
    plastic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I remember I was a marketing professor when they did this and they sent
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to marketing professors an empty bottle or an empty plastic bottle of Coca-Cola。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in their iconic shape because they were so happy that they had managed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to reproduce this in this new medium because they understood how important that
    was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And another very famous bottle， of course， is the Heinz Ketchup bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've been told this is in the Smithsonian and I'm not sure that's true， but
    it could be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it's a museum piece people recognize the quality of the ketchup because
    of the shape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the bottle。 And this again kind of like the absolute bottle is pretty interesting
    because that shape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in that glass bottle makes it difficult to get the ketchup out of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's not even a product that helps the product use the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It actually gets in the way of using the product and yet still it really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really defined the quality of that ketchup by the shape of the bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So shape is extremely important at causing， at creating brand imagery and brand
    identity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And shape also can be in and of itself an excuse for a new product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: One of the most successful new products in the soft drink industry was the refrigerator
    pack。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They did some market research and they found out that if the cans of soda were
    in the back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the refrigerator people did not consume it as much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if they wanted people to consume the product they needed some mechanism to
    bring the cans。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the front of the refrigerator so people could drink it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that these refrigerator packages were designed that way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that package design single handedly increased market share for the companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that started doing it。 It was a very successful new product introduction and
    it didn't have anything to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the actual product but just the packaging。 And similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hunt came out with a package for getting ketchup out。 That's easier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you turn the product upside down it's easy to get the ketchup out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/55068ea6fd86954718039f8144eaada4_18.png)'
