- en: So in this section， what I want to focus on is an introduction of a framework
    that I think you'll find very useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For figuring out how to think competitively to become a leader in your market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what I'm going to go over is based on a book that was written by Tracy and，
    Vereseman。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's called Market Leadership。 And it's based on their framework， although I've
    adapted it some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the framework， or what I'm going to think of it as kind of a graph or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the strategic tool is based on a set of principles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These principles have to be true and you have to believe in them in order for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this framework to work。 And they're very strong principles。 They're very strong
    assumptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't think they're that controversial， but they're not vague。 They really
    are very strong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in order for this technique to work， you really need to abide by them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the first one is that you have to know your markets。 Now， before I mentioned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most businesses are now in customer focus marketing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the type of marketing most businesses are doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because most businesses are very competitive， they're global。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a lot of competition out there。 And the only way they're going to win
    in their marketplace is to focus on the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer。 So that's a very important principle in this framework。 It says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in order to use this framework， we are going to assume that you know what， your
    customers want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And furthermore， you know how your competitors are likely to react。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what you're trying to do is what I mentioned， that principle of， differentiation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're trying to find a way to provide customer value better than， the competition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the only way you can really deliver this is to know your markets。 And you
    can't just guess。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to do market research and you have to really understand what your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers want and how your competition is likely to react。 So that's the first
    principle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second principle， and this is where it's pretty， it's a pretty defined and，
    pretty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a definite assumption that's being made。 And the assumption says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what I've written here is customers have the final， say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what that means is the customers are going to choose what they want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the assumption is a strong assumption because we assume that the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers go through this decision process。 They look at all the data and all
    the values and all the attributes and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the products in the market and there's so much information out there that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can't consider everything。 And so what they do is they kind of chunk a
    bunch of different things together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into kind of three bundles。 And the three bundles are one is all sorts of operations
    factors which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: includes price and cost but delivery， service， reliability， all those kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things are considered operational things。 The other bundle is product features
    are designed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So product attributes， style， innovation technology and they put that in， another
    bundle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the third bundle is whether or not it meets my needs。 So is it customized
    to meet my needs？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what the customers have the final say says is that customers look at these，
    three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they kind of classify the products into these three bundles and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they kind of give them a score on each one of these three dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then they decide which one of those dimensions is the most important to
    them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they pick the product that's the best on one of those dimensions and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: good enough on the other two。 So it says you can't be pretty good in all three
    of them because then the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer won't pick you。 But the customer is going to pick something not that's
    kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if they care about， price， they're not going to pick something that's kind of
    a good price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're going to go for the lowest price。 Or if they care about design。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not going to be something that's kind of， good design。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're going to go for the very best design that they like the most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or if they care about how much it meets their own needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're going to go for something that meets their needs the best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As long as the product delivers satisfactorily or good enough on the other，
    two dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's a very strong assumption。 But if you think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it kind of approximates the way customers make， decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you believe that assumption that the customers have the final say and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they choose the product that delivers the best on the bundle of attributes they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: care the most about， that suggests that if you want to be the first in the markets，
    that you serve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you better be the best at something and good enough at the other， two things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that should be your market strategy。 And once you decide on which type of
    thing you're going to be the best at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the market leader at， then that has implications for the way you structure your，
    business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way you prioritize resources， the way you allocate resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the type of people you hire into your company。 It has all sorts of implications
    for your business organization so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you can deliver total value and total quality and guarantee the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: satisfaction on this dimension。 So those are the assumptions。 Now before I show
    you the framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have to introduce one other concept。 And this concept is what I'm going to
    call their value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_4.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And what I have on the screen here is a value map。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you have on the vertical axis relative cost to the customer and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the horizontal axis relative benefits。 And what the map says is that if you
    offer more benefits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers are willing to pay a higher price。 If you charge a lower price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers will expect fewer benefits。 As long as what you offer appears to be
    there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you offer something inferior and it's not fair value， then customers won't
    buy that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you won't make it in the market。 You'll be canceled out of the market because
    you're not offering a fair value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what the framework says is that you need to offer fair value on two of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those bundles but offer something better than fair value on one of the bundles。
    On the bundle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're going to be the leader of。 So if you can imagine a marketplace where
    everybody's trying to deliver fair value and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: somebody's delivering something superior value， think about what's going to
    happen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in that marketplace in a very competitive market。 Somebody comes out， let's
    say Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comes out with a better design。 And so the iPad comes out and it's a much better
    design。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's fair price on these other axes but their tablet is better than everything
    else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What happens in the marketplace？ And what happens is everybody tries to copy
    and mitigate the advantage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what happens is what perceived to be fair value， that fair value line
    is not a static line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's constantly moving up， moving to the lower right， as the market gets more
    and more competitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_6.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So what's fair value is constantly changing over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So although I say what you need to do in this framework is to deliver the best
    at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something and stay fair value on the other two bundles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the problem is fair value is not a static concept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's constantly changing as a function of competitive reaction。 So with that
    said as background。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here's the framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And here are the three bundles。 One of them is operational excellence， the others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: performance superiority。 That's the bundle that delivers on product design and
    style。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And third is customer intimacy， which says give the customers what they want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're intimate with customer needs and， you try to deliver something that's
    responsive to their needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the three cross hatches here are fair value lines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I had them draw on symmetrically on this axis， but， it doesn't have to be
    symmetric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you need to do if you want to use this framework is in your marketplace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: figure out what are the product attributes that relate to， operational excellence
    in your market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And define that dimension so， that you understand what operational excellence
    is in your market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to do the same thing， what are the product attributes that matter to，
    the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they design， technology， whatever it is， what are those attributes and define
    that dimension。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you have to figure out how much customization is there in your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: market and define that dimension。 That's the first thing you do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second thing you do with this framework is anticipate where fair value is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the trickiest part of this framework。 What are customers expectations
    on each。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think of these as axes like an X， Y and Z axis。 And where is the reference point
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fair value line on each of these axes points？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Sometimes people think about fair value as the average of what everybody offers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes fair value， nobody offers。 Like for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would say in the airline business people expect an operational， excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: constant on time arrival。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And we know very few airlines deliver to that fair value。 But that is what I
    think people expect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I would say most of the competitors in the market are below fair value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_14.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Sometimes everybody's above fair value。 In some mature markets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people don't care about some of the bells and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_16.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: whistles that come out。 And everybody's delivering at least what they need and
    some people more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_18.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: but people don't even care about that。 So figuring out exactly where fair value
    is on each of these axes is a very tricky。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thing and you need market research to do that。 Once you figure out where your
    fair value is on these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the next part is to plot where your company is delivering on each of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: axes relative to fair value。 Are you above fair value in operations？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are you meeting fair value or below fair value on each one of these axes？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you figure out where your competition is on each of these axes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you start playing the market strategy game。 You think about a short
    term strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a long term strategy， and， you figure out what should you be doing right now
    in order to beat the competition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what you're ultimately looking for in a long term strategy is to be the
    best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at one dimension and good enough on the other two。 That's the long term strategy。
    In the short term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it might be that， let's say， your long term strategy is to be， customer intimate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you're not at fair value in operations。 So in the short term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might be looking to hit fair value in operations， but in the long term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're looking to be the leader in customer intimacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And once you decide what your leadership strategy is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then that has implications for everything you do in your firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_20.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So for example， if you're an operational company and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's what you want to be your leadership strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that tends to be a very hierarchical strategy that with allocation of resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: prioritized to information technology， etc。 If you're a performance superiority
    company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that tends to be more of an R&D company。 You tend to hire kinds of people that
    are very innovative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: They don't like structure。 They don't like top down organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You really need to give them a lot of free reign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/63a6d4840f5576e5a9cbfe2429fa18e5_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And in the customer intimacy， you really have to focus on prioritizing， market
    research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer knowledge。 And you kind of have a consulting， a yes culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to let the customer come first。 So once you decide on your leadership
    strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it has a lot of implications for the rest of the firm。
