- en: I'll start off with a story。 This was an air traffic controller strike。 It was
    in 1981。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and nearly 13，000 air traffic controllers went on strike。 They were negotiating
    over wages， hours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and benefits， and they're negotiating with the， federal government。 Now， you
    can think about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the 18，000 air traffic controllers， they're controlling all of the flights
    throughout the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: United States。 Now， the president of the time， Ronald Reagan， he was a new president。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and he came out and， said， "They're in violation of the law。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They do not report for work within 48 hours。 They have forfeited their jobs
    and will be terminated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"， Okay？ So he issues this threat， he''s threatening to fire 13，000 people
    who are controlling。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of the air traffic in the United States。 Okay？ So this happens on August
    3rd， two days later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so he said 48 hours。 Two days later， August 5th， President Reagan comes out
    and he carries out his threat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He fires the 11，359 people， so 11，359 air traffic controllers who didn't show
    up for work。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these air traffic controllers hadn't believed that he would follow through on
    this， threat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but Reagan made the threat。 He followed through on it， and by October 22nd。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the air traffic controllers union was， officially decertified。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So he won around their traffic controllers。 He ended up pulling people from
    the military to get a patchwork solution in place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He ended up retraining， filling these positions， but he effectively followed
    through on his， threat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as a consequence of this， the US Attorney General， Edwin Mies at the time，
    considered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this the defining moment of Reagan's presidency。 That is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he saw this as the foundation for Reagan's subsequent successes because he built。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: credibility by following through on this threat。 So Reagan ended up with a lot
    of legislative and diplomatic successes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and part of it was， because of the credibility people had with him。 So in this
    case， very dramatic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was a use of a threat， and it ended up paying dividends for Ronald Reagan，
    those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are expensive course of action to pursue。 What I want to think about is when
    should we use threats。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what do they do， and how， do we respond to these threats？ So first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about when to use threats。 We do it when we want to get attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it feels if people aren't paying attention， they're not taking it seriously，
    want to grab。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that attention， a threat will do that。 It'll also send a message that the status
    quo is not acceptable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You want to change how things are going。 Or in Reagan's case， to set a precedent，
    and in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: build credibility。 I'll think about two other threats in the context of strikes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Canadian auto workers went on strike in '84。 Each day on the strike cost
    the company millions of dollars in lost production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And after 13 days on strike， General Motors conceded to all the key demands
    of the auto， workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here， there was a threat that's carried to go on strike， GM capitulated，
    and that threat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was very -- that threat of the strike and continued on strike was very successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: About the same time in 1985， Hormel meat packers went on strike in Minnesota。
    However。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was ready to keep production going。 They actually served in the factory themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they ended up hiring replacement workers， who were willing to work for less
    money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they were able to fill demand。 And in that case， few of the demands were
    ever met。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and most of those employees end up， losing their jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The meat packers had overestimated the impact of their threat going on strike，
    trying to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ruin the company， and they ended up losing。 So here are cases of threats that
    are going in both directions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So threats that effectively worked and threats that didn't， based upon how much
    power you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually have， and notice we can make bad miscalculations。 Now here's a more
    disturbing example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2004 in Iraq， militant seized a South Korean man， and they delivered an ultimatum，
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: threat to South Korea， pull your forces out of Iraq， or we'll be sending this
    hostage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: head back to you。 You have 24 hours。 Now this threat's difficult。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's 24 hours to remove troops is really quick。 South Korea officially refused
    to halt their military deployment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then in a second， video was released only two days later， showing this man
    getting decapitated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here these militants had followed through on this gruesome threat。 Now the
    following month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a Filipino truck driver was taken hostage。 These kidnappers in the video said
    the last few months to a troop has to leave Iraq on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this date， and if he goes beyond end of the month， we're going to behead this
    truck driver。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the Philippine government quickly withdrew the 51 member presence they had
    in Iraq。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hostage was then released the next day。 Now in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a very disturbing course of events， but I think about it from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a threat perspective and this credibility perspective， what's going on that
    is how are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they able to effectively change international policies， and they're able to
    do that by falling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through on a very disturbing threat。 So we can think， we can look at threats
    and figure out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， sometimes they work， sometimes they don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we want to think about when they do and when they don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now here's the study about using threats。 Williness。 Are you willing to follow
    through？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The threat has to be credible and you want to avoid threats that are going to
    hurt you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more than your counterpart， but often falling through on threats is very costly
    to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it was costly to Reagan to fire all those workers and replace them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was costly for the whole male meat packers to hire all new workers， at least
    in the short， run。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we need to make sure we have a threat that's really costly to the counterpart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the GM example， the threat was more costly to the other side and that makes
    it effective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want the demands to be reasonable。 Can the other side comply with the demands？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You notice that in that hostage taking example， the first threat was not reasonable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It built credibility。 The second threat though gave a month to remove 51 people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was a more reasonable demand and that ended up gaining compliance。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's think about interests。 So what are their interests？ What are your interests？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to avoid rash threats。 We want threats to come from a place of calculation
    where we want to gain compliance to further。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: somebody else's interests。 So we don't want to punish people。 We want to motivate
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we can all get back to work， we'll be productive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's a way to avoid some bad consequence as opposed to a bullying kind
    of threat， which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is likely to promote reactants。 Now still， some of the examples we talked about
    showed effective threats that were really bullying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they're not a foundation for a long-term relationship and they're likely
    to motivate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people to try to retaliate。 Now we also want to think about saving face。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we don't want irrational threats or wimpy threats。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to make it easy for the side to meet demands as if they're choosing
    because again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can incite reactants and revenge。 So we want to build respect and build credibility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those are the key ideas rather than just throwing out threats as a way that
    can actually undermine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our credibility if we don't follow through or people call us on them because
    they're calling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our bluff。 And then finally， we want to be exact when we're conveying a threat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to be very clear about if you do this， then here's what's going to
    happen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you want to set a clear deadline。 We want to be very clear about consequences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to be specific。 And remember， if we don't follow through， we lose credibility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if we do follow through， it's often costly， at least in the short run。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the idea about delivering threats。 The next idea is how we deal with
    threats。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when people make threats， we should recognize that these threats push our
    neurological buttons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We really crave retaliation。 That is we want to go beat up that person that
    issued a threat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one reason why we should be very judicious and careful when we issue
    threats because we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pushing somebody else's buttons and that reactants is likely to blow up back
    in our， face。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when it's happening to us， my recommendation is to avoid escalating conflict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to be very careful about being just reactive， even though that might
    be what feels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: best in the moment。 Now， on this side， we want to be very careful about conceding
    too quickly because if we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: concede to somebody who's making threats， we're encouraging them to operate
    that way and we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lose power。 So one thing we might do is ignore a threat。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is what a lot of hostage negotiators do。 Hostage negotiators will frequently
    talk through a threat deadline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So some hostage will say， "Look， this is the deadline。"， And right before the
    deadline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the negotiators will get on the phone。 They'll start talking through and they'll
    try to move the conversation forward somewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and never go back to like， "Hey， you said you're going to throw somebody off
    a building。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you never did。 They don't come back to it， but they talk through it。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they're ignoring that threat。 And often， when we look at these studies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: negotiators abandon their threats most of the， time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 77% of the time when the threat goes unreciprocated。 As we respond to threats。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to think about a few key things。 One is trying to figure out the motivation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what's behind that threat？ It could be that the person who's issuing the
    threat feels like a victim。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they feel frustrated or offended。 They feel neglected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this threat is coming out of a desire to be heard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they feel like they can't grab attention unless they issue that threat。 If
    that's the motivation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's really important， they're calling out for attention， they care， deeply
    about this issue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They want to give them careful attention。 It could be they're just being pragmatic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they have a really strong alternative。 And this is how they're going to deal
    with you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is how they see the playing field。 And they want to gain leverage with
    this threat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third case is they're just bluffing。 This is how they have done business
    in the past or flex insecurity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the threat really isn't serious。 They just found that issuing threats are
    a good way to gain compliance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you want to think about where this threat is coming from。 And we want to
    respond appropriately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if somebody is just trying to gain attention， we want to express understanding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to listen。 We want to figure out what their grievances are and express
    understanding for their troubles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to soothe their concerns。 Now we should also ask questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how intense is this threat and how intense is their feeling about it？ And
    if it's a pragmatist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can come up with creative solutions to address it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if it's somebody who's just bluffing just to gain compliance as a matter
    of practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to label that behavior。 And we really want to counter it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we like to call it out or ignore it completely。 And sometimes when we're
    really stuck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we have to do is deliver a counter threat。 Now remember， I said this could
    escalate conflict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but sometimes to establish credibility， we， issue a counter fight saying， look，
    if you do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here's what we'll be forced to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d2d015fa366f474b055ef3fa97cadb35_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But none of us wants to end up in that place。 Let's try to get somewhere else
    or I understand that you're feeling upset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you take that course of action， here's the response that we're going to have
    to follow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through with。 But let's see if we can figure out a more creative way for us
    both to get what we need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we like to remove beyond threats and really deescalate them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you can't just give in to every threat because we'll lose our own credibility，
    our， own power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that could be in the long run what's really most important。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
