This course is going to be a little different than some of the other traditional business。

![](img/39bfe40ee05cddb8c14ca71ff205ed8c_1.png)

school courses that involve analytic skills or leadership methodologies because this。

course is almost entirely about you。 And you are the best judge of where you are with the questions that the course is going。

to address。 And so one way to take this course and use it would be to just simply look down the。

list of topics for the different sessions and weeks and click on one that looks like。

it's especially interesting or timely for you。 And just jump right in in the middle and then sample a few and begin to get a sense for。

the relevance of the material that we'll be talking through and how you can connect to， it。

You may want to start at the beginning and work for a while on the materials in the order。

that we put it。 But then jump to the end you may find that you have some urgent questions about something。

like meaningful work or career。 And so go ahead and feel free to click on the parts that have relevance to that question。

and you can always come back and get to the other parts another time。

Or finally we've made this course so that it's a coherent structured experience from。

beginning to end。 And if you simply start at the beginning and work your way through to the end I think you'll。

find that the topics build on one another， that they're related in a sequence that makes。

sense and you'll find it rewarding to take it in a traditional way just the way you might。

take a course on another subject。 So I hope you'll feel free to use the course the way it works best for you because as I。

said this course is really about you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
