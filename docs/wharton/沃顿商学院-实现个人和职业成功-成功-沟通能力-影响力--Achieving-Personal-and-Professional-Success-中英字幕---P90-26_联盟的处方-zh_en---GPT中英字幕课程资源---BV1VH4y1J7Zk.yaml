    shown him that conflicts almost always have hidden solutions。
  prefs: []

- en: This is an opportunity for forming coalitions and it's a risk if you're using
    these negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: behaviors that will get in the way of your forming coalitions。 So this again
    we see in the apes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's go back to Franz de Wall and his study of chimpanzees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking at how fundamental coalitions are and how fundamental this reciprocity

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: potential challengers。 So apes are doing this， apes are using coalitions and
    it's making a difference in their influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is clearly something available to us。 One of the implications is that you
    might bear some costs in order to have a more stable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sustainable coalition。 So you might improve your long term position by accepting
    lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps what even might， be seen as unfair payoffs in the short term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this may be one of the reasons we do see coalitions where the disparity in
    payoffs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is more equal than you might expect。 So one of my favorite examples comes from
    university athletics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: collegiate athletics in， the United States。 Teams compete as a part of a conference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So schools group together in conferences and one of the things schools have
    to do is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the revenues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A huge percentage of what they receive from college athletics come from these
    big television。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: contracts。 How do you divide that money across all the different members of
    the conference？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take for example two organizations in two different parts of the country in
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: conferences in the University of Texas and the University of Alabama。 So Alabama
    Crimson Tide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is the most successful football program of the last 10 or 20 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and one of the most successful of all times。 They're kind of the flagship program
    of the Southeastern Conference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the Southeastern Conference is known as being a stable， successful， probably
    the best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: football conference in the country in the last 10 or 20 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do they divide their television revenues？ The primary source of revenues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They divide it equally。 Equals parts to each school。 So from big， strong Alabama
    down to little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe not so strong， Vanderbilt， they receive， the same television monies。 In
    fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have such a strong coalition that another equal share goes to the league，
    office。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So much they value their coalition and they pay more equally there than you
    might expect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result， they have this incredibly， as a result of other things as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But one of the factors is this equal split， they have this strong coalition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrast that with the University of Texas and the big 12。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Known as being one of the most unstable coalitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've lost university affiliates over the last few years as they migrated
    away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the reasons schools often give， one of the reasons observers think this
    happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is because they don't equal， they don't share their money equally across the
    school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the University of Texas， kind of the flagship organization of big 12， has
    always demanded。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and received far more pay from the television contracts than the other schools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We think that this is one of the reasons that they have a weaker one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now Texas could argue it's fair， it's only fair that they get paid more but
    it comes， at a cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It comes at the cost of a weaker coalition and in the long term they may end
    up with less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't know for sure but it's a great illustration of you might take a little
    bit less as the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bigger party at the table。 You might take a little bit less to secure a stronger
    coalition and a more sustainable。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
