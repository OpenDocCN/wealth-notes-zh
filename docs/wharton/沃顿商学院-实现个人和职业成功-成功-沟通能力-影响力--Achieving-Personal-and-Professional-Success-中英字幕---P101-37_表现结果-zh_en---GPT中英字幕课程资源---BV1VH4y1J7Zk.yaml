- en: they kind of fit together， how they cohere or don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we haven't yet related that to anything else。 We don't yet know why it matters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The theory is that those behaviors will make a person more or less influential
    but we haven't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shown any evidence of that so far。 In our 360 degree surveys when we ask these
    third parties to provide evidence we also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: include an additional few questions。 We consider these performance questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a battery of questions that are intended to measure a person's impact in
    their organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to hold constant the level of responsibility they have， maybe their
    technical skills and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ask given where they were and what their portfolio was， did they have a big
    impact or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little impact on the organization。 So the survey questions are all getting at
    that and they are very close to each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and together they form this well behaved battery and the responses come on this
    nine， point scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a little bit different scale。 It's from much less than expected to much
    more than expected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4b1b90dec56dab0f28a7ac60ab1e3222_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We aggregate up to a single performance measure。 This is what it looked like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is our first 400 or so students and you can see a kind of a normal distribution
    there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of impact or performance in organizations。 These students come from MBA programs
    at Yale and Wharton a little bit Columbia NYU so it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps isn't too surprising that they're all almost all above expectations
    but the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: question becomes okay there's still a distribution here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can we see anything that helps us understand why some would be on the right
    side of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: distribution with even higher performance。 Some might be on the left side even
    lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can we understand and ideally can we help people move from the left side to
    the right， side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at how those data relate in our survey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we have performance measures and these behaviors we can see how they
    relate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is a picture and at this point we have this is about 850 MBAs and executive
    MBAs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what we've done is we've plotted that performance metric that battery of
    questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that boils down to a single performance metric。 We've plotted that on the y
    axis in terms of standard deviations above or below average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then on the x we've plotted the frequency with which the participant is
    reported doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these things。 We have 12 different plots there。 Those are the 12 different tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each one shows influence as reported by the third party raters related to their
    use of， the tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example in that top left corner that is the agency tactic and you can
    see that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well we've thrown little summary curves on each of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are little lowest non-parametric lowest curves to give you a sense of
    what the trend， is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what do you see？ This is the first of our really kind of empirical exercise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you see in these data？ So I think the first thing to see is that they
    are all positively related。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That in all 12 cases more of the behavior is related to， is positively related
    to more， impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's this positive correlation between doing these things and being reported
    as having。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: impact in organizations。 The other thing you see is that they're not all equally
    related。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So some are steeper than others and that steepness indicates a tighter correlation
    between the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: behavior and the outcome， the impact。 So for example agency is quite steep。
    The steep is typically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intentionality is quite steep。 Coalition is pretty steep。 And then others are
    a little bit flat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So ethos for example， a little bit flat， might a little bit flat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allocentrism kind of disappointingly flat。 They're positive but not as doesn't
    seem to be as tightly connected to impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A third thing you might see is that there's less variance on some tactics than
    others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example intentionality turns out our MBAs and executive MBAs are relatively
    tightly， packed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're all pretty intentional folks。 Whereas might and ethos much more variance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then some of them seem to kind of round off。 There might be diminishing
    returns to some of these tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas agency and intentionality don't seem to diminish much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We see ethos and might and team building kind of kind of topping and not quite
    turning over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but flattening out some。 But again big picture。 We're getting evidence now that
    the frequency with which people use these tactics is connected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the impact they're seeing is having in their organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can aggregate that up to these factors we were talking about。 Soft power，
    smart power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hard power。 Again， we all have positive relations。 And by the time we put them
    all together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we get a pretty tight， pretty positive connection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between the frequency with which people are exercising the tactic and the impact
    they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: having on their organization。 Finally we can begin to get a sense of how these
    tactics matter differently in different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: situations。 Eventually， maybe in another 10 years， we'll be able to tell you，
    well， this is kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a recipe in one industry and this is a different recipe in a different industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't have that level of granularity right now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we do have results from multiple business schools。 And we can ask， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the data saying the relative importance of soft power， smart， power
    and hard power are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in this graph what I'm going to show you is the regression coefficients on
    smart， hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and soft power when we regress influence on each of the students' soft， smart
    and hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4b1b90dec56dab0f28a7ac60ab1e3222_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: power scores。 So for each student， we know their impact in their organizations
    as reported by their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: third party raters。 And we know their scores for how often they're using soft
    power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: smart power and hard power。 And we can just ask， okay， at Penn， what's the regression
    say？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How important， what are the returns to soft power among the students at Penn
    relative to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their influence returns to smart power and ask the same for all four schools。
    This is what we find。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， what do we make of it？ These are regression coefficients， remember？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first thing you'd say is， well， it looks like smart power and all four
    schools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: smart power is reported as being either the most important or tied for the most
    important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the three。 Terrifically interesting because people hadn't even studied smart
    power before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As far as we know， this is the first empirical study of first empirical operationalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and study of smart power and yet it's popping out as the most important one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you do see some differences across schools。 So for example， NYU and to
    a lesser extent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Columbia， soft power isn't as important among， the students and where they've
    worked before they came to school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's kind of stereotypical， especially with NYU。 Most of those folks， not
    most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a large percentage of those folks come from financial services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and financial services is not an industry known for the importance of soft power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might flip it around with Yale， for example， where soft power comes in as
    more important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than hard power。 Again， kind of landing right on top of the stereotype since
    Yale's known for doing more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not-for-profit work than other schools。 And then Penn， not to tutor on horn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they do have this perfectly balanced ratio of smart， power and hard power
    are equally important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least according to the data at this point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4b1b90dec56dab0f28a7ac60ab1e3222_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: in time。 So a little sense in how the ratio and the kind of the recipe for optimal
    influence will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: vary by situation。 We see it varying even in the situations that students have
    been working in across schools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[ Ambient Noise ]。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4b1b90dec56dab0f28a7ac60ab1e3222_9.png)'
