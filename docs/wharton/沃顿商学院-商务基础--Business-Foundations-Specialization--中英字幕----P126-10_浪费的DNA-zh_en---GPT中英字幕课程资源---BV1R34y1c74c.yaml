    unique。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we will see that there is a common pattern when we look for inefficiencies。
    What I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you to do in this module is really learn how to figure out the DNA of waste。
    The module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is relatively light on math， but please don't hold this against the idea of
    lean。 And we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also emphasize that the idea of lean operation is really present throughout
    all modules in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this course rather than being squeezed into this single module。 As often， let
    me kick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: off this module with a personal story。 Now a little while ago， I needed to get
    an MRI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with a contrast agent， which is a relatively simple radiology procedure。 And
    so I got。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an appointment here at Penn Medicine's radiology department for 10 o'clock，
    10 a。m。 She had an MRI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I arrived at the hospital at 9 45。 I arrived at the radiology， I gave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them my name and they conferred my appointment time。 And then to my pleasant
    surprise， similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to what you see at some restaurants where you are checking in to wait for a
    table， the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hospital gave me a little buzzer。 I said to myself， "That's kind of cool。" They
    really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thought about the waiting time experience here。 So I took my buzzer and I sat
    down。 To。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my even bigger delight， about 15 minutes later， at 10 or 5， the buzzer started
    buzzing。 That。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was fast， I thought。 Unfortunately， it was not my turn to be examined as scheduled
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my radiology appointment。 Instead， I was now allowed to really check in。 So
    I checked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in at the different check-in booths at 10 10， go back and wait it。 Now at 10
    20， also， not too bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: eventually the nurse called me。 I was directed to the changing room over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here in this part of the hospital。 I changed and I waited。 I was stuck in a
    room with a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: television that couldn't be turned off。 Finally， at 11 o'clock， I was called
    by the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nurse and she directed me to the imaging room。 I waited in the imaging room
    for about another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 20 minutes until the radiologist showed up。 For a few minutes， he explained
    me what he。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was about to do with me。 We had the procedure which took about 10 minutes。 I
    was directed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back to the changing room and instructed to wait to make sure that the images
    turned out， alright。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then I could ultimately change back into a normal close and about two hours
    later， at 12 o'clock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was out of there。 Let me ask you this。 Where did you see inefficiencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/00b05ffa00f7081fa930d42ce88fa778_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: during my morning as I journeyed through the hospital？ We'll get back to some
    inefficiencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of this story later on in this module。 For now， I wanted to talk about two grandmasters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of operations management。 Let me start with Fredrik Wences of Taylor。 Taylor
    wrote a famous。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: book "The Principles of Scientific Management"。 He wrote this book well over
    100 years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In his studies of workers， Taylor believed in careful and systematic observation。
    Oftentimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he was able to obtain dramatic improvements in productivity， typically it's
    a waste reduction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: picking the right man and tools for the job and setting the right incentives。
    For the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/00b05ffa00f7081fa930d42ce88fa778_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: better or for the worse today the word "tailarism" is unfortunately used more
    as a curse word。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the reasons for Taylor's decline in popularity is that Taylor had a rather
    difficult。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relationship when it came to human beings。 He was interested in their muscles，
    not in， their brains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But please allow me to nevertheless share two quotes with you from the principles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of scientific management。 So first Taylor wrote， "We can see and feel the waste
    of material。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and things。 Awkward， inefficient or ill-directed movements of man however， give
    nothing visible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or tangible behind。" And then the other quote I wanted to share is kind of weird
    but I really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like this one。 Employers derive their knowledge of how much of a given class
    of work can be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: done in a day from either their own experience which has frequently grown hazy
    with age， from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: casual and unsystematic observation of their man or at best from records。 I
    really like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these quotes。 I think they are as important now as they were 100 years ago。
    At the heart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of this modulus the idea that we need to measure the amount of work that is
    done by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our resources and that measurement is hard。 It is really hard。 The data is not
    easily available。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the fact that it is hard shouldn't keep us from doing it。 The second gentleman
    I would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like to quote is Thijeone。 Thijeone was really seen as a father of the Toyota
    production system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So two owner quotes。 First owner wrote， "Moving is not working。 The Toyota style
    is not to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: create results by working hard。" And then the second quote reads， "All we are
    doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is we are looking at the timeline from the moment the customer gives us an order
    to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: point we collect the cash。" As I think back to my radiology experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then begin with the second owner quote。 Here is my timeline from the moment
    I entered the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hospital to the moment I left the hospital。 You can see that only a small fraction
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that time had really to do anything with medical imaging。 I needed that day
    about 20 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of care but I spent two hours and 15 minutes in the hospital。 So that was really
    a waste。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of my time。 Now maybe the hospital design or process was the objective of maximizing
    hospital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: efficiency rather than optimizing for the patient experience after all hospitals
    are under significant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: amount of cost pressure。 So maybe they did a good job on efficiency and not
    on my willingness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pay。 So let's think about the hospital efficiency。 How about the person who
    gave me， the buzzer？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Was that person adding value？ A massive waiting room in the lobby？ Was that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: needed for improving my patient experience？ How about the person who checked
    me in and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: confirmed my paperwork？ Was he or she adding value？ So you see where I'm going
    with this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an example of hospital resources， let's look at space。 Space is really expensive
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hospital operations。 Hospitals are really space constrained and have to pay
    for expensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: real estate。 Since I had consulted for this hospital at prior times， I asked
    the management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to share a floor plan of the radiology unit with me。 Now let me ask you this，
    which space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on this floor plan adds value。 Right。 At the end of the day， the value is generated
    in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imaging room。 Given that I was waiting for 20 minutes in the imaging room， that
    room and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that expensive equipment in there were clearly not running at a high level of
    utilization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now given that patients don't spend 20 minutes in the department， but over two
    hours， we have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to put these patients somewhere。 And what are patients sitting around？ Exactly。
    They're， inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And an inventory of patients requires space。 And what do you need when you have
    elderly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: man like me sit around waiting for an hour， especially when you think of a water
    fountain， nearby？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's not go there。 As you can see from this example， hospitals， the hospitals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are really short in space， but they really primarily consist out of lobbies，
    waiting， rooms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: restrooms， utility rooms and so on。 All of this space exists for a good reason。
    Don't， get me wrong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But most of this space doesn't add value to the patient。 This gets me back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to my process analysis module。 Remember how I introduced two perspectives to
    the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in an operation？ We can take the floor units perspective in the case that would
    be the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: patient and look for where the patient wastes the time。 This was really the
    idea of owner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking about the timeline。 We can also take the perspective of the resource。
    It is the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: employee's real estate， the imaging machine。 That is a much more tailor-risk
    perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The waste of my time or the waste of the time of the resources here， note that
    none of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really has left a record behind。 This is why I like the tailor quotes so much。
    Awkward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inefficient or indirect movements of man leave nothing visible or tangible behind。
    So one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the key things we need to do in this module is to learn how to carefully
    observe how work。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/00b05ffa00f7081fa930d42ce88fa778_7.png)'
  prefs: []
