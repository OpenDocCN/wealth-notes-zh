- en: Let's think about some of the cues we can use to detect deception。

- en: So what changes when people start telling lies and what can we do to try to
    detect those， changes？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out one of the most important things that changes is how we feel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So our emotions change when we engage in deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have some emotions like fear and guilt and sometimes also happiness with
    what's been。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: called duping delight。 So our emotions are different when we're lying than when
    we're telling the truth and sometimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can attend to those differences。 Second， we have what's called cognitive
    load。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have more on our minds。 We're just thinking about a lot。 As Mark Twain said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the difficulty of telling lies is you've got to keep track of the truth， and
    the lie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we just have more on our minds。 We have to keep two stories straight and
    we have to control our own behavior and we have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to monitor others to try to gauge how gullible they are or how suspicious they
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're engaging in more cognitive effort and there are cues because of that
    that can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also help us detect deception。 So one key emotion that changes when we lie is
    anxiety。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we're telling lies， we often feel greater anxiety and in fact that's
    a lot of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the polygraph is designed to test。 The polygraph has been called a lie
    detection machine but it's really an anxiety detection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine。 So we do things like with a bicep cuff， we're measuring heart rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now while at our heart rate go up when we're lying， it's because we feel anxiety。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The electrodes on their fingers that measures perspiration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now perspiration is another sign of anxiety。 We have pneumatic tubes around
    the chest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those measure breathing。 When we're breathing faster， it's because we're feeling
    anxious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So often when people are lying， they're feeling greater anxiety and that's what
    the polygraph。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can help us detect and we can try to look for some anxiety cues in natural communication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the face for example gives off some anxiety cues。 People tend to press their
    lips together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They tend to blink more quickly。 Their voice tends to be higher in pitch and
    we often engage in some movements that reflect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: anxiety。 So we might rub our foreheads， we might squeeze our face or rub our
    neck， we might engage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in some sort of flash frozen that is a frozen kind of expression。 We might bite
    our lips。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are all cues of anxiety。 We might ask ourselves why would somebody be
    so anxious telling us this story or giving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: us this information。 And one reason why they might be anxious is because it's
    not true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So anxiety is one place to look to help us detect deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it turns out that there's often so much anxiety around telling lies that
    if we scare。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people a little bit， they're actually likely to spill the beans and be more
    honest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So polygraph testing， the mere prospect of it is often enough to get people
    to confess。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now some people will just be so scared of participating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They will refuse a polygraph because they're so afraid that it's going to be
    so diagnostic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of their deception。 It turns out it's just anxiety but the polygraph is actually
    a useful tool not only because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it detects anxiety but also because it actually scares people into often confessing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next we think about disrespect。 When people lie to you， it is often a sign of
    disrespect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people who are lying sometimes also use sarcastic responses， they'll talk
    down to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a target or they exhibit some sort of contempt as they're engaging in deception
    or they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing things that demonstrate a disregard for the target。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they'll be picking lint off their clothes， they'll be rolling their eyes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they'll be demonstrating， disrespect and that often accompanies deception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So deception is an egotistical move。 I think I'm better than you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think I can keep the truth from you and disrespect is sometimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accompanying that deception and we can look for those cues as something to cause
    us to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: probe more deeply。 Now often what we lie about are emotions themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm really happy to have you join us。 Oh I'm happy you asked me these tough
    questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes we leak out the right or our authentic emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you're telling me something and I need to look at how you're saying it。 And
    I might feel like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hey wait a minute， you said you're really happy to see me but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you don't look like you're happy to see me or I saw a flash of a grimace or
    an uncomfortable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expression and I'm suggesting that we should pay attention to that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is there's sometimes these cues of mismatching emotions or even quick expressions
    of emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that can lead us to engage in further sort of careful examination of what's
    really going， on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So often people leak emotions。 Now there's also sometimes a mistaken emphasis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as we're trying to think very carefully about what we're saying， I might
    put an emphasis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the wrong word。 Like I'm really happy to see you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The emphasis shouldn't be on I'm really happy to see you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That might be a sign of deception because we're cognitively loaded and we're
    not getting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the emotions quite right as we're speaking。 Another related cue is a lack of
    synchrony。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's related to this cognitive load idea is that I might say， oh， I've never
    done that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before and then shake my head as opposed to I've never done that before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we're doing things asynchronously that is I'm saying something and then
    doing the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: corresponding body movement that nonverbal cue might come later because I'm
    cognitively， loaded。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can't keep track of everything at once。 I've got to control myself from not
    nodding like， oh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do that all the time。 What I'm telling you that I don't do it ever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the lack of synchrony is another cue of deception。 It turns out leakage is
    part of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So micro expressions are expressions that are less than a 20th of a second，
    sometimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as long as a 5th of a second， but very fast。 Again， with video， we can see these
    very clearly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but in natural communication we often miss， them totally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But nonconsciously we might process and say， hey， you know what？ I know Maurice
    was telling me this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I don't feel quite right or it。 He didn't seem completely authentic and
    it could be because there was a flash where I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: said， oh， I'm really happy you came by， but if we actually saw it in slow motion，
    we'd。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see that there was a grimace in there for maybe a 20th of a second that conveyed
    my real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: happiness or lack of happiness that you actually stopped by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And sometimes leakage just means that our expressions are incomplete。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So my smile isn't a full smile。 It just goes part of the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So sometimes we leak out emotions that convey some uncertainty about how we're
    really feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that we should be paying attention to。 There are many facial expressions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People have documented these pretty carefully。 And so there's a facial action
    coding system and there are ways to get trained to actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: detect these micro expressions and to get better at understanding how all the
    facial movements。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: are supposed to move in concert。 So like the dishein or authentic smiles， it's
    not just the smile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's also the movement， around our eyes。 So there's a lot that we can do
    to try to figure out how to focus our attention in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways that guide us to detect deception more effectively。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
