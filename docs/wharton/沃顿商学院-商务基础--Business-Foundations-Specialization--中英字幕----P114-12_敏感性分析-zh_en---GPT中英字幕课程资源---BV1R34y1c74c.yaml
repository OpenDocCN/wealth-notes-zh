- en: Last time， we applied our different decision criteria， to our forecasted free
    cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to come up with a decision as to what to do with our tablet project。 This time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to push those assumptions around， the forecast drivers and other assumptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to see how robust our decision is in a process called sensitivity analysis。
    Let's get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hey everyone， welcome back to Corporate Finance。 Today we're going to be talking
    about decision criteria。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but as always， let's start with a recap of our last lecture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So last time we talked about decision criteria。 In particular， we asked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do we do with our free cash flow？ And there were several things we could
    do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could compute an NPV， we could compute an IRR， or we could compute a payback
    period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we talked about how to implement those decision criteria， and what decision
    to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we also alluded to some of the shortcomings， of those decision criteria。
    Today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to turn to sensitivity analysis。 In other words， having set up our DCF。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and having completed all the inputs， now let's push it around a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and just see how robust and sensitive our valuation is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we can make the most informed decision possible。 So let's get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're going to start with something called break even analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Break even analysis finds the parameter value that sets the NPV， of the project
    equal to zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: holding fixed all other parameters。 So let's look at our cost of capital and
    an initial investment forecast drivers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I've got base up here to represent a base case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to look at alternative cases in just a minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see our base case assumption for the cost of capital was 12， just a
    little over 12%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And our initial investment was $227。7 million。 The corresponding NPVs for those
    assumptions were 708。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 42。 It's the same， it's the base case。 That's what we computed in our previous
    lectures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The break even values， in other words， the value for the cost of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: such that the NPV right here is zero， is 43。72。 But that should look familiar
    because the break even point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the cost of capital is nothing more than the IRR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as we discussed in the last lecture on decision criteria。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see there's a lot of room here before this project looks bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least on the cost of capital dimension。 For the initial investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our initial investment would have to be closer to a billion dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before this project started to turn negative。 Now how did I get these？ Well，
    I just used goal seek。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I did is I set the NPV cell， for example this cell， to zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I would change the input parameter。 And goal seek goes around by iterating
    it to find the zero value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now I did this for all of our inputs， and I can only show you a subset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and otherwise things get ridiculously small。 It doesn't fit well on the screen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what I like to do when looking at the break even estimates is gauge， how
    much room I have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least in a partial equilibrium notion。 Because remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm only changing one parameter at a time， and I'm going to emphasize that again
    in a second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to look at how much breathing room I have until the project turns
    south。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or becomes negative NPV。 And so you can see these purple arrows identify parameters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for which there seems to be a fair amount of scope for error， a large margin
    for error。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So take a look at the PPE liquidation value here。 I'm assuming I'm getting 50
    cents on the dollar when I liquidate all of my plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and equipment at the end of the five years。 It would take a loss of 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 253 percent before this thing turned negative NPV。 I'd have to be dealing with
    some kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe nuclear waste， right？ Something like that。 But that's not the case here。
    Similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the initial unit price， unless we're going to price this thing at $77， just
    over $77 per unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this thing is positive， this project is positive NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is in contrast to some of the parameters for which there doesn't seem to
    be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quite as much margin for error。 So if I look at my initial market size。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm looking to the initial kind of trade， sorry， initial market size of a million
    units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if there's not a lot of enthusiasm， say only half a million， little over
    half a million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this project becomes NPV negative， again， holding all other parameters constant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this break-even analysis， I think， is a useful tool for gauging how much
    room we have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one dimension at a time， before the project becomes value destructive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I want to emphasize that this is a partial equilibrium analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It assumes the parameters are independent， right？ I'm changing one parameter
    at a time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in some cases that's an unreasonable assumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not to say the break-even analysis is uninformative， it's just that we
    have to recognize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the limitation of that analysis。 Now let's turn to some comparative statics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And comparative statics are going to quantify the sensitivity of evaluation
    to variation in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: parameter holding fixed all other parameters。 So what I'm going to do is I want
    to look at how does evaluation change parameter variation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from what I'll call a worst case to a best case scenario for each parameter。
    And again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to focus on the cost of capital in the initial investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And by my estimates in discussion with Treasury， right， the sort of range of
    estimates for my。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cost of capital， very from a low of 9。61， which is a best case scenario， right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very inexpensive cost of capital， to a high of 15。01%。 Likewise， my ops people
    tell me that this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the initial investment is likely to be $227 million， but it could go as high
    as $284。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could go as low as 185， depending upon short-term variation in materials
    and labor， et cetera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay。 What I see underneath each parameter estimate is the corresponding NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when I change the cost of capital of 15。01%， the NPV of the project is $594
    million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I increase the cost of the initial investment from $227 to $284， right，
    the NPV moves from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: $708， our base case to $649。47。 So I actually like to look at this table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is to get some sense of the sensitivity of the valuation to specific， to
    changes in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: specific parameters。 But I also like to use it as a gut check， a reality check。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to make sure that the， valuation varies sensibly with variation in the parameters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I had found that as I increased the cost of capital that the valuation here，
    the numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually went up， I've got an error somewhere in my model。 Okay。 So how did
    I get this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just used an Excel data table。 So these are inputs right here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So all you do is highlight the matrix。 The NPV of the project is here in the
    bottom left。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The parameters are in the top row。 And you choose a row input cell and enter
    the parameter cell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's it。 Nothing more than a data table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And I did this for all of the parameters， though I don't show you all the parameters，
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it's just useful to move through them to make sure things make sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I look at initial market share， for example， right here， what I see is
    a worst case scenario。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of 15% or penetrations only 15% versus an initial penetration of 35% -- sorry，
    an initial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: penetration of 35% in a best case scenario。 And you can see that the valuations
    increase with our penetration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which makes sense。 We're selling more units。 And notice they actually increased
    by a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to see that that's an important value driver。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is the elasticity of the valuation with respect to each parameter？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's similar to what we did， but it puts a little bit more structure on the
    changes in the parameter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we can compare the sensitivity of the valuation to different parameters a
    little bit more sensibly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is the elasticity？ Well， it's just defined as the percentage change
    in the NPV divided by the percentage change in the parameter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or delta -- remember this is nothing more than change -- the change in the NPV
    divided by the change in the parameter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: times the ratio of the parameter to the NPV。 Let's look at an example。 Here's
    my cost of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I've done is I've gone computed a cost of capital that is 1% higher and
    1% lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I've computed the corresponding NPVs。 So to estimate the elasticity of the
    NPV with respect to the cost of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've simply looked at the delta NP -- sorry， yellow。 Get rid of that guy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Delta NPV over delta parameter -- delta in the cost of capital。 So I've taken
    the 7 -- this guy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 703。53， minus the 713。34。 And I've divided that by the difference of 12。13 minus
    11。89。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I multiply that times the average of the two numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is really just the average of the parameter values。 This is the average
    of the NPVs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And obviously these halves cancel one another， but I wanted to put them there
    to emphasize that I'm just taking the average of these two points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the reason I'm doing this is because the elasticity will vary depending
    upon which direction -- the direction in which we calculate it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not by much， but by a little。 So this is just a useful -- this is one possibility
    or one approach for computing it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the elasticity I get is minus 。69。 So a 1% increase in this -- in the cost
    of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a 1% relative increase I should add， in the cost of capital， is associated with
    a 。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 69% decrease in the NPV of the project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And I can do that for all of the parameters。 Again， I'm just showing you a few。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you can see a couple parameters start popping out very quickly， such as
    the initial market size。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our assumption on the market growth rate， right？ Our initial market share。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our assumption on cost of goods sold。 These， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are going to correspond pretty closely to what we saw with our breakeven analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they're really identifying the key value drivers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The things we should really be focused on when discussing this project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But， again， like our previous analysis breakeven and our little scenario analyses
    -- well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not scenario， sorry -- our comparative statics。 Comparative statics implicitly
    assume parameters are independent of one another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're varying one parameter at a time， and sometimes that just doesn't make
    sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's going to lead us to scenario analysis。 What scenario analysis is going
    to do is it's going to quantify the sensitivity of the valuation to variation
    along multiple dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can vary multiple parameters。 So what I've done here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going back to that best and worst case scenario， is I said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's the worst case scenario for all the parameters here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the best case scenario for all the parameters。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's not necessarily the optimal thing to do， but it's illustrative。 You might
    want to say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's sort of the worst case scenario if the economy goes south？ Right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How's that going to affect each parameter？ It may not be the worst case for
    each parameter individually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but jointly it might correspond to some sort of bad economic state of the world。
    Having said that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've computed what I've set up each of these scenarios -- worst， best， base，
    and best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I've just done a little scenario analysis。 And what I find is that in the
    worst case scenario。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this project is over half a billion dollars negative NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best case scenario is 33 billion positive NPV relative to our base scenario。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wouldn't read too much into those numbers。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because I've taken the worst case scenario for each parameter independently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that doesn't make a lot of sense。 Again， what you want to do when you're
    constructing these best and worst case scenarios is think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: okay， let's think about a bad economic state of the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where maybe not everything goes horrible in the project， but where some things
    go bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and maybe other things are good。 So if it's a bad state of the world， maybe
    labor costs go down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ And it becomes cheaper to build the plant。 You want to think about these
    things and how parameters are related and what really represents a plausible best
    and worst case scenario。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now， how did I do this？ I just used scenarios in Excel。 That's one way to do
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's how I initially did it。 But that's actually really inefficient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A much better way is to set up a lookup table and a toggle that you can just
    switch all the parameters between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Much more efficient。 So here's a question。 What else can we do with sensitivity
    analysis？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can answer some important questions that are going to come up in discussions。
    Here's one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example。 Imagine strategy wants to reduce the price by $30 in order to increase
    the initial market penetration from 25% to 30% by their estimates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Does this make sense？ Well， we can answer that question。 In this table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what I've done is I've set up a little two-way table。 I've got quantity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our initial market share right here， initial penetration and price here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So these are all prices。 Here are all my market shares。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's our base case scenario in which we're assuming 25% initial market share
    at a unit price of $200。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And marketing is asking， what's going to happen if we change these？ Well， in
    particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they want to lower the price by $30 from $200 to $170。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they argue that's going to increase our market share upwards of， say， 30%。
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what does that mean from a valuation perspective？ Well， if we look in this box
    right here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we see that the NPV is going to be somewhere between $776，851 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what's the answer to the original question？ It's a good thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NPV is going to go up relative to our base。 Here was our base。 Marketing says，
    drop the price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That increases penetration。 And sure enough， valuations go up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it sounds like a sensible thing to do。 Marketing， on the other hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is concerned about uncertainty surrounding the market for tablets and wants
    to understand if we can shed any light on that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Can we provide some information？ So here's another two-way table。 I've got market
    growth rates here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Market growth rates there。 I've got market size assumptions here， initial market
    size。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's our base case indicated by the black outline boxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the initial market size was going to be a million units， and we were assuming
    2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 500% growth in that next year。 But what this picture shows is it shows that
    as that growth varies and as that market size vary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what happens to the valuation？ The cells inside are NPVs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I've color-coded them so that green is at or better than our baseline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see our baseline is all along。 I've held the baseline constant along
    the diagonal here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All 70842。 Yellow is positive NPV， but worse or below the base case NPV。 And
    red is negative NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so this provides some picture of how much slack we have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least along the initial market size and market growth rate assumptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Finally， I want to talk about simulation analysis。 Simulation analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to perform the valuation for a large number of scenarios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A whole bunch of different parameter values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b309e13db9065ccaed2b6fa4e0b40387_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And what I did is I selected 500 different scenarios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I did is I just randomly drew parameter values from a distribution constrained
    by the best and worst case scenario for each parameter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I did that 500 times。 And I computed the NPV for all 500 draws。

- en: And I plotted them here in a histogram。 So I have here the NPV on the horizontal
    axis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the y-axis is the fraction of the 500 simulated scenarios corresponding
    to each NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this red dashed line is the zero NPV value。 And what you can see up here
    is 77。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 78% of the simulations are positive NPV。 22。2% are negative NPV。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the takeaway is it looks like a pretty good bet。 This project looks like
    a pretty good bet。

- en: Conditional on all of the assumptions that we've made to get there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've been able to push it around through a host of different scenarios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this thing tends to be a positive NPV project， value-accretive。 That said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to emphasize that the parameters were drawn independently of one another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's not ideal。 It's going to lead to some implausible outcomes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's not a particularly reasonable assumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially when it comes to certain parameter pairs， such as price and quantity。
    That's just one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally you want to draw from some large， multi-variant distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now we're moving way outside the scope of this course into evaluation exercise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I want to do is instead emphasize the importance of simulation analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even small-scale simulation analysis。 So you just laid out by hand 10， 15 different
    scenarios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computing powers cheap。 Compute the NPV and just look at how those NPVs look
    across the different scenarios。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I really want to emphasize that no DCF is complete without a sensitivity analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's really an integral component of any valuation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any sort of capital budgeting or broader valuation， I should say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to help us identify where value is created or destroyed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to identify the key value drivers where we should really focus our
    time and effort in terms of our discussions for making the decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also going to help us quantify and assess our risk exposure。 How much can
    we lose？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How frequently can we lose it？ And it's going to help us understand the robustness
    of the profitability of the project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So next time we're going to turn to a new topic， return on investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is actually closely related to our decision criteria。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're really going to hone in on IRR and look at some of its strengths and weaknesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
