- en: influence strategies。 So let's look at what these are。 You can think about it
    in a few。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different buckets。 First， this persuasion bucket。 Logos， pathos， and ethos。
    These are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the components of Aristotle's rhetoric。 We've seen them in our section on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: persuasion and we'll talk about them in a little more detail as we go through
    the， individual tools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second bucket is relationships， dyadic relationships。 You。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might think about them as negotiation relationships。 This set includes， exchange，
    might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and allocentrism。 And then the last bucket you might think of more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as the structure of relationships。 More the macro look at your relationships。
    And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these include networks， coalitions， and team building。 So this set of nine comes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from kind of a common framework， almost conventional wisdom out there on what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the influence strategies are。 So we've listed them here in three columns。 One
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the leverage inventory。 And then another is the hey groups tool。 This is one
    of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: early industry tools that assesses influence tactics。 And then a third， column
    with McKinsey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the consulting firm。 They train their consultants on， influence tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we've lined them up so you can see how common each of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rows is basically tapping into the same thing。 So you only need ten rows to
    cover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the nine topics that all three groups are covering。 The point here is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's pretty much a canon， a conventional wisdom around what the key， influence
    tactics are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to go beyond this， but this is our starting， place。 These are the
    first nine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I want to do is go through each of these， nine and give you just a quick
    summary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also identify the survey questions， that are related to each of these tactics
    so that you know you want to tie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your results to to these concepts。 The first is allocentrism。 So this is the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: opposite of egocentrism。 This is an other orientation。 A person who actively
    seeks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: others interests and considers their preferences。 It's related to empowerment，
    collaboration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's related to what Jeff Efre refers to as sensitivity to others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's related to the negotiation framework。 First put out there by Errian Fisher，
    getting to yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The survey questions we use to operationalize this concept are， listed here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They include looking for solutions that will benefit all the， parties involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not going to read each of them， but listens， attentively when listens attentively
    when others talk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is trying to， understand where the other side is coming from。 Not necessarily
    to give them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everything they want， but let's understand where they're coming from。 Allocentrism。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A second is exchange。 This is a willingness to to quid pro quo， but a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: preference for going beyond it。 So it's highly related to reciprocity， which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've talked about in previous lectures。 It's highly related to Bob Axelrod's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: game theoretic concept of tit for tat。 The survey questions here include things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like offering rewards to people for compliance， understanding the need to help。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: others in order to get help from them。 We use six different questions to build
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: scale to tap into to reflect what exchange is。 A third is might。 Might is a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: willingness to use coercive power。 More generally an ability to address。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: difficult issues and tolerate conflict。 So in the very beginning of this course，
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talked about French and Raven and their notion of coercive power。 This is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tightly connected to that。 We operationalize this with survey questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like standing up for his or her opinion， able to tolerate conflict， letting
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know when they perform below expectations。 These all group under this umbrella
    of， might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my experience in the classroom， this is something that students， some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: students really struggle with。 Some， many of them need to exercise this a little，
    more freely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even if it's not on a daily basis。 And then there are some on the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other end of the spectrum who probably need to dial it back a little bit， perhaps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might be a little too comfortable exercising might。 Another concept is， networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea here is to cultivate a broad and disparate set of informal， relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is connected to the notion of structural holes。 Research by， Burt and before
    him， Granovetter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We talked about that earlier in the course。 Survey questions here are things
    like maintaining relationships that span。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: disparate groups or making an effort to become friends with colleagues at work。
    Another concept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coalitions。 We have an entire day on coalitions， so you're well， tooled on this
    by now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Identifying and getting the support of key people， it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: connected in some ways to childini's social influence。 It's connected to animal，
    behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We saw multiple examples from Franz Duall， the primatologist and the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: concept we talked about the practice of having the meeting before the meeting。
    So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we operationalize this with questions like and listing the support of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: individuals one by one in order to build support for an idea。 Another tactic，
    team building。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is building groups， prioritizing cohesion， highly connected， to organizational
    culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the concept of socialization。 The questions we use， here are prioritizing
    group cohesion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: helping articulate an inspirational， vision for a group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making appeals to values or principles shared by the group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these are around building teams and keeping people closely connected。
    Another concept， logos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is back to Aristotle and the notion of persuasion。 Using logical reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expertise or data to convince or persuade others。 So five， quick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: punchy ways we operationalize this， finding ways to make points as， simply as
    possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gathering data to support his or her position， using arguments， that are well
    reasoned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is something our MBAs typically do pretty naturally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so this isn't the hardest part of persuasion but many people still need to，
    focus on this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A second component in persuasion is pathos。 This is conveying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: message in a way that has emotional resonance。 Of course this again comes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from Aristotle and Cicero。 It's connected to the readings we did by， Heath and
    Heath。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the ways we operationalize it。 Using stories to help， make my points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the things many people mostly did add to their， rhetoric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tailoring communication content and style to this specific audience。 So we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have six different ways here。 We talked about persuasion in some detail a couple，
    of lectures ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Heathos， the third and final component of Aristotle's rhetoric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: establishing personal credibility through credentials， commonality and decorum。
    You。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meet others expectations for your role。 So it does connect to some of Chaldini's，
    concepts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarity and authority， it connects to the French and Raven idea of， expert
    power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We operationalize it with a couple of items， four items， presenting ideas with
    confidence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making his or her efforts and， accomplishments known。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the things that adds some flavor to this， particular concept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people struggle with this。 What we know is that people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will be more persuasive if the audience understands their credentials and their，
    credibility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge though is we know we don't like to be told by other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people what my credentials and credibility are。 So how do you get that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across so that you'll be more persuasive without being a jerk and turning people，
    off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's one of these wonderful little challenges in influence。 So that is an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: overview of the first nine。 And that is again kind of the conventional wisdom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the canon in the field。 And that's where we started when we first started using，
    this tool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: building this tool years ago。 But in working with executive MBAs and， studying
    the literature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we thought there were a few components missing and we've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: added three and we think of them as meta tools or kind of tools to figure out
    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to use the other tools。 They are agency intentionality and situation awareness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's spend just a little bit of time understanding what these three mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Agency is shaping situations， influencing circumstances to suit needs， challenging
    status quo。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accepting nothing is fixed。 It's connected to the ideas of， initiative and control。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's connected to research and sociology on rule breakers。 We see many examples
    in this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Robert Moses， Jeanette Saude Kahn that， illustrate this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the behaviors we assess through questions。 Creating new， alternatives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: acting before being asked to。 And again Jeanette Saude Kahn， she is a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/67477165da72ad669714c1cdacdf3f1c_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: great illustration of this。 Here she is Transportation Commissioner was in recent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: years Transportation Commissioner in New York。 And she gets credit for these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pedestrian only zones in New York。 She really transformed the landscape in New。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: York in a way that no one would have thought possible cutting through red tape。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: largely on the heels of her agency。 She did other great things but she was not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: willing to take anything as fixed。 Most folks think she was the most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influential Transportation Commissioner since Moses and we mean Robert Moses，
    there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you look at our data， which we will in a minute， this always shows up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every group we've ever tested shows up as the most important strategy empirically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/67477165da72ad669714c1cdacdf3f1c_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The second of the new tools is intentionality。 Intentionality is acting， with
    a goal in mind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Relentless pursuit of goals， eschewing distractions and， secondary rewards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is connected to Jeff Efert talks about it as focus。 There's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: obviously decades of research on goals。 We've seen examples in this course from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Robert Moses and Sergio de Melo， which I'll elaborate on again in a minute。
    The。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: survey questions we use to assess this include things like is careful to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of。

- en: '![](img/67477165da72ad669714c1cdacdf3f1c_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: goals。 And again Sergio de Melo illustrated this for us。 We thought we saw。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sergio in the very first lecture in this course。 He is the late UN ambassador
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when he died he was thought of as probably the top diplomat in the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We studied him while he was running essentially East Timor。 And some of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things we read about him in the book by Samantha Power about him is that he
    was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"ruthlessly pragmatic" that with experience in his career he learned to， trade
    lesser evils。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This all means that he was making trade-offs。 He was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sacrificing lesser goals in pursuit of his bigger goals。 One way to think about
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that if you're not sacrificing some of your preferences and some of your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lesser goals you're probably not working with enough intentionality towards
    your。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/67477165da72ad669714c1cdacdf3f1c_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: biggest goals。 Finally， situational awareness。 Attending to situational， power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: uncertainty and importance and especially how these factors change， over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This concept comes to us from the military。 Those of you who have been， in the
    military。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the US military at least know how often you're trained and drilled， in SA situation
    awareness。 SA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The aviation industry has picked it up and from， their other industries are
    adding it to their to their training repertoire。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's， connected also to psychological research on things like change blindness
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: change detection。 We talked about it some in the Cuban Missile Crisis that we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talked about early in the course。 Some of the survey questions here are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recognizing when circumstances change， recognizing when uncertainty is high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: seeing opportunities that others miss。 One of our favorite examples comes from。

- en: President Abraham Lincoln， President of the United States in 1861 to 1865。 We
    can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: use Lincoln to illustrate any of these leverage inventory concepts。 He was one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of these guys who was extraordinarily adept at the full range。 He played the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: full range but he gives us a nice illustration of situational awareness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially around knowing when to wait and knowing when to double down。 So when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fighting a war against the south。 Everyone wasn't on board about the， Emancipation
    Proclamation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was great debate there。 He himself debated it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a long time and eventually came to believe that it was time to issue this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: proclamation free the slaves。 It was the summer of 1862。 They were one year
    into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Civil War and he came to his cabinet and said it's time to do this。 I've，
    debated it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you guys think？ And they all went around and gave their， reactions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It has said that he had thought of all of them except for one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: His Secretary of State Seward said I like the idea but it's a bad it's a， bad
    moment to do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bad timing。 We are presently losing the war。 If we do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now it will look like the desperate act of a of a weak government。 He encouraged。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lincoln to set it aside until the war had turned and then it would be received，
    better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lincoln saw the wisdom of the suggestion and did in fact put it in his。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: death drawer and sat on it for six months or so and then on the heels of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that here's Lincoln on the eve of making one of the grandest gestures a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: government has ever made and he decided the timing wasn't right。 He。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
