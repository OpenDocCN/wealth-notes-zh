    Air flight。
  prefs: []

    Air。 On this slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've compiled some data from big global airlines。 Airlines in the United States
    are regulated and so you can get access to pretty cool operational。
  prefs: []

    after this slide。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to mention yields。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the video for a minute and ask yourself which of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    All right， welcome back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are the results of your exam that you get it right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll get back to the airline data in a moment。 For now， let's just observe
    the following。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An airline can provide great services and can compete on quality aiming for
    a high willingness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pay。 If they do this， well， they can get away with somewhat higher costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But an airline can also focus on efficiency。 If the airline manages its costs
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you take a course on strategy or marketing， you will learn a number of tools
    to help you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the trade of between cost and quality。 In this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to take a slightly different perspective。 Every individual firm faces
    a trade of between costs and willingness to pay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's called as a cost-quality trade-off。 Consider the following exam。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The German railway system is going through some operational transformation。
    And trust me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they need it。 One of the areas they're working on is their cost center operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about willingness to pay in a cost center， waiting time is an important，
    sub-dimension。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Who likes to wait listing to beat off music？ Imagine their current's performance
    is here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is their waiting time， and this is their full improvement cost measured
    in dollars or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: euros per call。 Now it is really easy to run a call center with short waiting
    times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You just hire an extra hundred customer service representatives and the waiting
    time is going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to come down。 Unfortunately， while your waiting times go down， your fulfillment
    costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your cost per， call are going up。 Note here that I've reversed the access。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Short waiting times means more responsive， which means further up on the y-axis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lower fulfillment costs means more efficiency， which means further to the right
    on the x-axis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But as far as that， it is really easy to cut costs in a call center and just
    reduce a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: head count and have fewer agents in the seat that will reduce a cost per call。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it will obviously lead to a worse service as customers will have to wait
    longer。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's a trade-off。 One way to think of operations management is as a strategy
    implementation tool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You tell me what position you want to be on on this curve， and I will build
    you an operation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that gets this done。 But here's another way of thinking about operations management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you and I would do some benchmarking。 We would go through the industry
    and for each of the call centers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we collect information， about the efficiency and their waiting times。 Our own
    position is here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We start our benchmarking with call center A。 Call center A has a shorter response
    time， than we do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which we understand when we look at the cost efficiency， which is worse than，
    ours。 Cool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These guys have made their cost quality trade-off differently from what we did
    and they hired。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a bunch of extra agents。 Then we move to call center B。 These folks have a longer
    wait time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lower response， list， which gets them down here。 Now， they're not incompetent。
    Instead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have squeezed their costs and are running a more efficient operation。 Good
    for that。 Third。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we look at competitor C。 And this is where we get puzzled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This call center is providing a better service than we are and they're more
    efficient as， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe they do not have a short of a response time as competitor A and are not
    as cheap。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as competitor B， but compared to us， they are faster and more efficient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The academic term for this is that competitor C parietal dominates us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now to stay with academic terms for a moment， we define the line of all call
    centers of， all firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of all operations that are not paraded or dominated by somebody else as the，
    efficiency frontier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes， they exist a trade-off between cost and quality， but this is the elite
    set of firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that has nobody providing better service at lower costs。 Sadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our own call center is not on the efficient frontier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can visualize our inefficiency as a distance between us and the frontier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inefficiency has two consequences for us。 First， the good news。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have reasons to believe that we can improve our quality while also cutting
    our costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can become a better operation and a better cost center。 This will be win-win。
    Second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to move to the upper right， we have to overcome some or all of our inefficiencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will require us to do some work。 We have to up our game。 We have to get
    better in what we do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， let's get back to our airline data。 Here's some data from the largest
    US carriers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also sprinkled in data from some of the global carriers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Please note that this is not a careful scientific study。 It is just an illustrative
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you think about this graph？ If you wanted to apply for a job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you wanted to make an equity investment， if you， were a management consultant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what goes through your head as you look at this graph？ You see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the efficiency frontiers are very useful to think about an industry。

- en: All right， that's it for now。 In this video， we moved beyond just pleasing the
    customer。 Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we would love to increase the willingness to pay。 But we have to do this with
    also achieving reasonable fulfillment costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And for that， we have to get rid of the inefficiencies in our operation。 In
    the next video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll discuss how such inefficiencies look like。 The purpose of this entire
    course then is to fight these inefficiencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I said before， we want to make things better， which means higher willingness
    to pay at lower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: costs of fulfillment。 See you soon。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
