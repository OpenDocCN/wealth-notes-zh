- en: Hello and Professor Brian Boucher。 Welcome back。 In this video we're going to
    talk more about inventory cost flow assumptions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you've ever been curious about what LIFO and FIFO means， this is the
    video for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you because we're going to go through LIFO versus FIFO in detail。 Let's get
    started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to start out with a key assumption。 And if you don't keep this assumption
    straight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're going to be confused for much of this， video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key assumption is that inventory cost flows do not have to follow the physical
    flow of， goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we talk about our inventory equation， that beginning inventory plus new inventory
    equals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cost of goods sold plus ending inventory。 If we think of physical flow of goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say we sell something like bananas， it's probably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the case that we're selling the oldest bananas first and keeping the newest
    bananas in ending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory。 So for the physical flow of goods， the goods in ending inventory
    are whatever specific。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goods that we haven't sold yet， probably the newest bananas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But for the flow of costs and costs are what we're actually running through
    the T accounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and journal entries， the costs in ending inventory could either match the original
    cost of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goods， so be the exact cost of every banana that we hold at any inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be the most recent cost incurred， so the cost of the most recent bananas
    we bought。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: during the period。 It could be the oldest cost incurred。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it could be the cost of the bananas that we bought。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a long time ago or an average of costs over time。 And three is often the one
    that people have trouble with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How could we use the oldest costs in ending inventory when we have probably
    the newest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goods we produced？ And the reason is that the physical flow of goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the actual bananas we hold in the， inventory， doesn't have to match the costs
    of those specific bananas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can make a different assumption of how cost flow versus how the physical
    flow of goods， flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Does that make sense？ Hopefully。 So there are a number of ways that we can do
    these inventory cost flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First one is specific identification， which would mean we specifically identify
    the cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of each product sold and the cost of each product held in inventory。 With computer
    technology today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think companies should have to keep the accounts for each individual， good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: giving me a compelling reason why any master does and specific identification
    should， be used。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's a compelling reason。 What if you made toothpaste or you manufactured
    salad dressing or gasoline？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then how are you going to use specific identification there？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How can you track a specific gallon of toothpaste or a specific gallon of salad
    dressing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You really can't。 So in that case， you'd have to use some kind of assumption
    about cost flows other than specific。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: identification。 Even with computer technology these days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it still would probably take up a lot of data， processing capacity to keep track
    of millions and millions of products with their individual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: costs。 So these cost flow assumptions just make things easier to keep track
    of without detracting too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much from providing a picture of how much your inventory and cost of goods sold
    really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cost to manufacture。 Another method that companies could use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is probably one of the most common methods， is FIFO。 First in， first
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means that the oldest inventory costs go into cost of goods sold first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the oldest inventory costs are the first one into inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they're the first ones to go out to cost of goods sold。 And because of
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the ending inventory is going to reflect the newest costs of the， inventory
    that we acquired。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The opposite way to do this would be LIFO， which is last in， first out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here the newest inventory costs are going to go into cost of goods sold first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the last cost to come into inventory through our most recent purchases or
    most recent manufacturing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are the first costs that we pull out into cost of goods sold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what's left in ending inventory are the oldest costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cost that we incurred potentially a long， long time ago， because what we're
    doing every。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: period is we're taking out only the newest costs， leaving behind the oldest
    cost of manufacturing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or acquiring inventory。 If I understand you correctly， you're insane。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now would a company sell the newest products first？ They would always sell the
    oldest ones first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: otherwise they become obsolete。 Exactly。 A company that sold bananas or milk
    could never use LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just think， I think is a rare house， would become with all of that old product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You forgot that assumption from the prior slide。 The physical flow of goods
    does not have to match the flow of costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So even a banana company could use LIFO without having a stinky warehouse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certainly they would sell the oldest bananas first and the newest bananas would
    be kept。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in inventory。 That's the physical flow of goods。 But in terms of costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you could still use LIFO and use the newest costs of bananas acquired。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as cost of goods sold and have the oldest costs of banana be ending inventory。
    So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the physical flow of goods doesn't have to match the flow of costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the last method that we could use for handling inventory costs flow is weighted
    average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where we have an average cost of inventory going into cogs and into ending inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in practice， weighted average ends up giving results that look a lot like
    FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm not really going to talk about weighted average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4a4012426fcfc1f856746756e5916ea5_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Instead， I'm just going to focus on the comparison between FIFO and LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I saw this advertisement， I don't know about 13， 14 years ago， in a lavender
    catalog。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which was called Inventory Management for Newspapers。 What are these things
    called newspapers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is that what Grandpa talks about when he said that you used to have to get news
    delivered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on paper to your door in the morning？ Yes， prior to the Netscape IPO in 1995。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which popularized the internet， many people actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got their news by getting physical pieces of paper called newspapers delivered
    to their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: door every morning and sometimes in the evening。 So while you were 10 years
    old playing video games and eating Cheetos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when your grandfather， was 10 years old， he was out delivering these newspapers
    at the crack of dawn earning a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nickel a day。 So I'm sorry for the stale example here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's good for you to learn a little bit of， ancient history every now and
    then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going back to our newspaper， Charlie example， LIFO would be a system where you
    would pull。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: newspapers from the top anytime you wanted to read a newspaper， which would
    leave all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the old newspapers at the bottom still in your inventory of newspapers， which
    is probably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how I would do this。 But that's the physical flow of goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way you really want to think about this is think about each newspaper as
    an invoice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So anytime you pay money for materials， labor， overhead， anything to acquire
    inventory， you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: put an invoice in the trolley。 LIFO would say that you pull the invoices or
    costs from the top。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those go into cost of， goods sold。 The invoices that are still at the bottom
    are the ones that are left in inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which， are the older invoices。 LIFO， which is how this is intended。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is you pull the newspapers from the bottom， leaving， the most recent newspapers
    still in inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now again， thinking about this in terms of costs， if this was a stack of invoices，
    LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would say pull invoices from the bottom， which means that you're taking the
    first or the oldest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: invoices in inventory out to cost of goods sold。 And what's left in your inventory
    is the most recent invoices or the most recent costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the difference in LIFO and FIFO with flow of costs。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: remember it's not flow of goods， but it's flow of costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I want to do now is throw some numbers at this and do an example of how
    LIFO and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO can affect the cost of goods sold and the ending inventory。 So in our basic
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in 2010 we're going to buy five units of inventory。 So to make it simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're just going to be a retailer。 We buy five units， we buy one in January，
    March， June， September。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and December。 And as you can see， we're in an industry where prices are rising
    dramatically throughout the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: year so that the January unit only costs us $10， whereas by December it'd cost
    us $30。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Under FIFO we have to figure out what are the costs and what are the ending
    inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if we sell three units。 So we're going to sell three units which means that
    the first costs that we acquired are the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first ones to go out into costs。 So that would be the $10， the $15。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the $20 coming up to a total of $45 for cost of， goods sold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's left in inventory are the September and December units which are $25
    and $30 for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a total of $55 in ending inventory。 Now if we sell those same three units but
    use LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now what we do is we take the last， costs in as the first costs out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the last three costs in are the $30， the $25， and the $20 which adds up to
    a cost of， $75。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's left in inventory are the first costs we acquired， the January and the
    March， $10。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: plus $15 which means their ending inventory is $25。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a difference of $30 in both of our costs to both our costs to goods
    sold and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our ending inventory between LIFO and FIFO。 Okay， you'll get different numbers
    for costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Close these costs。 It is what it is。 You are telling me that a simple accounting
    choice can have such a big effect on profits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well for costs you can't use the old it is what it is because every time you
    look at costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of goods sold in a financial statement it's the product of certain assumptions
    of how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory costs flow。 The company could have made different assumptions and
    it would have been a different number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there is no absolute truth or absolute standard for what COGS is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a product of assumptions and the assumptions could be changed and you'd
    get a very different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: costs。 So keep in mind when we go through this this is not a trivial decision
    because it could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have a big impact on COGS and hands-on unit income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continuing on to 2011 we're going to come into 2011 with different beginning
    inventories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: depending on whether we did FIFO or LIFO as we saw from the prior slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So FIFO has the most recent costs in inventory。 LIFO has those oldest costs
    in inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact another term for LIFO could be fish first in still here and FIFO could
    be lish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: last in still here。 Although many people refer to LIFO as LIFO backwards which
    would be awful because it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an awful way to do accounting。 Anyway so we come in with very different beginning
    inventory and then we purchase three units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: during 2011。 Again prices are rising so we purchase a unit in February for $35
    April $40 October for $45。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now we're going to look at FIFO and LIFO separately for FIFO where we sell
    three units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: during 2011 again。 First in first out so we grab those first three costs from
    inventory 25 30 and 35。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's become our cost of goods sold first in first out， cost is 90。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These last two purchases of inventory the last two costs are what stick around
    an ending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory so 40 plus 45 gives us an ending inventory of 85。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if we sell three units under LIFO here's what it's going to look like last
    in first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out so we start at the right we go back three units so 45 40 35 our cost of
    goods sold is， 120。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our ending inventory are those first costs that we acquired first in still here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our ending inventory is still just 25 so when we compare the two the difference
    in， COGS is 30。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LIFO is 120 versus FIFO of 90。 Higher COGS for LIFO reflecting that prices have
    been going up during the year so the last。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cost in are higher than the first cost in and there's an enormous difference
    in ending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory 25 versus 85 which is reflecting the entire increase in prices since
    we started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: building inventory since those costs in LIFO are the first costs that we ever
    acquired whereas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the cost in FIFO are the last costs that we required。 You are insane。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It simply is not plausible that companies could have such different values on
    the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goods and inventory。 LIFO must require you keep the older goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am not insane and in fact this does happen in the real world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LIFO came into the US sometime after World War II so if you look at companies
    that have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: been around since before the 1940s in their ending inventory some of those costs
    could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reflect cost from the 1940s the 1950s the 1960s so yeah you could have some
    really really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: old cost still in inventory even though of course the goods are not still there
    but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't worry we'll see a disclosure later which will allow us to adjust for that
    age。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: difference in costs and find out what inventory would be using more recent costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay let's finish up this example so in 2012 we're not going to buy any more
    units we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just going to sell what we have and go out of business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So under FIFO when we sell those two units we just take those two costs out
    of beginning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory and our cost of goods sold is 85。 For LIFO when we sell our beginning
    inventory our cost of goods sold is only going to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 25 which means our cost is going to be $60 less than it would be under FIFO
    if we use LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so LIFO cost is 60 less than it would be under FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The low LIFO cost in 2012 is due to dipping into the old LIFO layers of inventory
    so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: anytime you sell more inventory than you produce you end up dipping in or going
    back to these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: old costs under LIFO that's called a LIFO liquidation and it has to be disclosed
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the financial statements because it has such a dramatic effect on cost of goods
    sold and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it income basically giving the company an extra $60 of pre-tax income this year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when your company says it is having a liquidation sale does that refer to
    LIFO inventory？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not necessarily a liquidation sale just means that you're selling a lot of inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use the term LIFO liquidation because you see this happen when you sell more
    inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than you produce which is what often happens when you're having a liquidation
    sale but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can have a liquidation sale without having LIFO inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a look at a summary of the cost of goods sold over time from this
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as you can see in 2010 and 2011 FIFO had lower cost of goods sold by 30 each
    year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but then in 2012 FIFO has 60 higher of cost of goods sold which means that the
    total cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of goods sold over the three years is identical。 So LIFO versus FIFO is going
    to change the timing of cost of goods sold but over the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: life of the firm total cost of goods sold are going to be the same either way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4a4012426fcfc1f856746756e5916ea5_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Based on this chart I would think that every company uses FIFO it gives you
    lower cogs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in every period except the last but by that point you are。 You are dead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: John Maynard can said in the long run we are all dead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wow that's a cheery quote to inject into a LIFO FIFO video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My key point is that cogs are going to be the same either way over the total
    life of， the firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes it's true if for some motivation you wanted lower cogs earlier on FIFO would
    deliver， that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there is actually a good reason that you might want higher cost of goods
    sold earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on and lower cost of goods sold later as you get under LIFO and I am going to
    talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that on the next slide。 So let's talk about why it would matter whether a company
    uses LIFO or FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when inventory costs are rising which is generally the case in inflationary
    economies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generally prices go up over time so inventory costs rise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This under LIFO is higher and ending inventory under LIFO is lower as compared
    to FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if it was the case that inventory costs were dropping over time then this
    would be， reversed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cogs under LIFO would be lower and ending inventory higher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But more common case is inventory costs are rising over time due to inflation，
    cogs under。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LIFO is higher。 In the US tax reporting allows you to do LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lower taxable income due to higher cost of， goods sold would mean lower taxes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the rule in the US is that if you use LIFO to take advantage of this potential
    tax。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: break then you also have to use LIFO for financial statements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's called the tax conformity rule。 This is one place where tax reporting
    and financial reporting does have to match up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you use LIFO for taxes you have to use that on the financial statements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me bring back that summary of cost of goods sold from the example to
    show you how。
  prefs: []
