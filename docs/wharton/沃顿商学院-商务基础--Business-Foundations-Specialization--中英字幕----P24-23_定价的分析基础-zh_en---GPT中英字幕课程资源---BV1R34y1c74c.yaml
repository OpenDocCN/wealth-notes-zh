    decisions。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And we will focus on three key topics。 One， we call margin and contribution
    analysis。 Second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: breakeven analysis and the third concept is economic value to the customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's start with margin analysis and let's do it in the context of a mini
    case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this case comes from a company called Wistecon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Wistecon is a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and they were the first to
    launch disposable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lenses。 And the first lens they launched was called HECU view， which was produced
    by a very unique。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: proprietary technology and it costed about 50 cents per lens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Patients were advised to wear these lenses for one week and then dispose them
    away and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then next week insert another pair of lenses in their eyes。 Soon after they
    launched HECU view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a number of reasons， some IKEA professionals suggested。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that patients remove these lenses and clean these lenses each night and replace
    them after。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two weeks。 Which was not exactly what Wistecon had suggested。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in response to this particular usage pattern， Wistecon decided to launch
    a new product called。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shor View， which was specifically designed for this type of usage， which is
    two week， usage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They priced it the same as AkuView， which is $2。50 to IKEA professionals and
    who charged， then $4。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 50 to end users。 At the time of this， Wistecon was thinking of launching a very
    different type of lens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: disposable lens， which they called as one day AkuView or daily disposables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This would be a product that would be daily wear， single use， truly disposable
    lens that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: offered both convenience and reduced health risk。 And these lens costed Wistecon
    about 25 cents to manufacture and they were priced at 65。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cents to the IKEA professionals。 And then the plan was to sell it to the customer
    at about 83 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's think through this planned launch of one day AkuView and ask ourselves
    what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: issues should Wistecon be concerned about as they launch this new product to
    complement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their existing product line of AkuView and Shor View。 So typically when I pose
    this question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I get several answers， but the one answer on， top is will the new product cannibalize
    existing products？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other responses I get is will consumers really want it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another answer here is will channel partners or IKEA professionals want to support
    it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then there are operations and production side issues。 Can we produce so
    many units？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do we have the supply chain and the distribution network to support it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So all these are important issues， but let's see how many of these we can address
    by doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: simple margin analysis。 So let's start with that process of margin analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at the margin for each of the three products， so let's start with
    Shor View。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the price to the patient is 450， the price to the ECP is 250， unit cost is 50
    cents， so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wistecon's contribution is $2。 If you look at AkuView， it's exactly the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you look at the one day which is the daily disposable， it's 83 cents
    to the patient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 65 cents to the ECP and the unit cost is 25 cents， which means it has 40 cents
    margin to， Wistecon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a question worthwhile asking at this stage is based on these margins， which
    of these three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products is most profitable？ People when they look at this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: students or executives invariably they'll say， "Presraju， the most common answer
    is one day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what I hear。"， And when I probe further， I ask why are you coming up
    with one day when $2 is actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more than 40 cents？ And I think they rightly say， "Look， it's not the margin
    per lens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's margin per consumer， which is each customer is going to buy many more of
    the daily disposables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than they are going to buy Shor View。"， So that is a good way of thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at that a little bit more carefully now as we go deeper into this。
    So $2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is the margin per lens for Shor View， we multiply that by 52。 Where do
    we get 52？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's replaced by weekly， which is 26 weeks。 You have two eyes， so you're usually
    52 lenses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So 52 times 2 is $104。 And then for AccuView， again， the per lens is $2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: multiply that by 104 because you're， changing it every week。 Two eyes， 52 times
    2 is 104。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You get $208。 But then you multiply the 40 cents margin on one day， which is
    the daily disposable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Multiply that by $730， you get $292。 So clearly once you look at it on a per-consumer
    basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you find that the daily disposable is， more profitable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where now the real discussion begins。 I asked under what conditions
    would actually show you be more profitable even when we look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at these data。 This is not an easy question。 But as we think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the answer comes in the following way。 If you were told that you can make only
    100，000 lenses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which ones will you make， then the， answer would be you will make only show
    views。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because from those 100，000 capacity， you can make $2 per lens and there'll be
    200，000。 But with 100。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 capacity to manufacture， you'll be able to satisfy very few customers。 And
    on each customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll make only $292。 So if your capacity were limited， then suddenly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: show view looks more profitable。 So the next question is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what capacity are we talking about when we are thinking of， $292， $208 versus
    $2。40？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the answer there is you're assuming that the number of customers you have
    is fixed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're going to be able to change each customer from one lens to another
    lens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if your number of customers is fixed or limited， then clearly the daily disposable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looks profitable。 But if your number of lenses you can make is fixed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then show view is more profitable。 So let's now put this in some perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We all worry about when we compute margins， we all worry about what is the numerator。
    By numerator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean， is it $2， $2， $1。2， $2。40， $40。 $41 is it $292 or $293？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I urge you to do is also think about the denominator。 Should it be margin
    per lens？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Should it be margin per customer？ And what does that depend on？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It depends on what is your key resource or your binding constraint。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your key resource happens to be or your binding constraint happens to be
    production， capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you should be looking at margin per lens。 If your binding constraint happens
    to be the number of customers you can access。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then， you should be looking at margin per customer。 So think about it， a traditional
    retailer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you ask them how do you compute your， margins。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they say we compute margins per square foot of shelf space。 Why do they do that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They do that because for a traditional retailer， shelf space is their critical
    resource。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can't change that in the short run。 But now if you ask a law firm or a
    consulting firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they don't say we compute margins per， square foot of office space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why do they not compute margins per square foot when a retailer does？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because office space is not their key constraint。 Their key constraint is the
    number of consultants they have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they compute revenue per consultant hour in deciding which opportunities
    are more interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or more attractive。 So let's reflect on this。 We all worry about the precision
    by which we compute margins。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is I often refer to， as the numerator。 What is strategically more important
    actually is the denominator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Should it be margin per lens， should it be margin per customer， should it be
    margin per。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: square foot or should it be margin per consultant hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b0323af56f3f1e75d85f038a8dec4c39_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It all depends on what is your key resource。 So if you do not do that right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everything else goes wrong because if you are computing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: margin per lens when customer is your key constraint， then you are most likely
    to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wrong decisions。 So keep a focus on the right denominator。 So in this particular
    case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we assume going forward that there is no capacity constraint。 So for Wisticon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the key constraint is actually the number of customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now let's start looking at another question that comes up in the discussion
    which is， will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the IKR professionals like this product？ So now let's start looking at the margins
    of the IKR professional。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you look carefully in the table， what do you find？ What you find is for the
    new product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the IKR professional is going to make $131。40 per， customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compare that with what they were making for AccuView。 For AccuView。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are making $208 per customer。 And for sure， we of course they were making
    less which is $104。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So once you look at the channel margins or the margin to your channel partner，
    I think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can conclude that there is a good likelihood that your IKR professionals
    will not be as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interested in this product。 But then I think a deeper discussion might lead
    us to say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what if it is cheaper for them， to sell daily disposables？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it's cheaper for them to sell daily disposables， then maybe $131。40 is sufficient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the answer to that is it's probably harder for them to sell daily disposables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They'll have to stock more， they'll involve more working capital and more space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it is not likely to be easier to sell daily disposables than it is to sell
    either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one week or biweekly lenses。 Also look at profit sharing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we look at the table for the earlier two products， SureView and AccuView，
    it's very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interesting to see that the annual contribution for ECP and Wistecon was exactly
    the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b0323af56f3f1e75d85f038a8dec4c39_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Which means whatever was the total size of the pie， they were splitting it equally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now we look at daily disposables， their plan is to actually split the pie
    unevenly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does that mean？ It means most likely it's not just about lower margins
    to the channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's also about fairness， or lack of fairness。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because now you're not going to split the pie evenly。 Let's say if you were
    to split the pie evenly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is change the price in such a way that， the two products now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all three products are shared 50/50 between you and the channel partner。 How
    do you get to that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well you have to lower the price to the ECP at 54 cents instead of 65 cents。
    Once you do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you get 211， 211， 211， 270， 211， 270。 Now all channel margins are equal between
    Wistecon and ECP。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then what you see is this product is really not that great。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because it makes just a little bit more than what they were making on the weekly
    product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we conclude from this？ What we conclude from this is a good thoughtful
    margin analysis can peel the onion and help。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: us identify A is the new product really better than our existing products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: B if we look at the margins more thoughtfully and include our channel partners
    also， then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can understand their incentives or lack thereof。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then finally we can also look at what the retail price to the customer is
    going to， be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course in the daily disposable case it's going to be higher than it was
    for show。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: view and active view。 So we have to worry about consumer response also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So simple margin analysis of the type we did lays open many interesting insights
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one has to keep in mind has been launches new products or prices them appropriately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is margin analysis？ It's simply a table of costs and prices for every
    member of the value chain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The person who's taking the idea to market channel partners and users for every
    relevant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product within the product line and often across competitors。 What it does？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It reveals everyone's incentives in a purchase transaction and a careful examination
    allows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: us the discovery of potential problems such as cannibalization and channel conflict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it also provides useful input for subsequent analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's move to the next concept which is break even analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again this is extremely useful in making pricing decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also extremely useful in making other business decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here we are going to talk about three different types of break even analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one we are going to talk about is let's hypothesize that the ACKVUE
    team or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the daily disposable teams in this case is planning to spend $2 million advertising
    budget。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do they justify such a budget to their senior management？ Second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we already discussed this partly， what if they were thinking of lowering the
    wholesale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: price from 65 cents to 54 cents in order to satisfy the IKL professionals？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much more would they have to sell to break even？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the third break even concept we are going to focus on which again is very
    critical is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much cannibalization can we tolerate from ACKVUE when we are launching a
    new product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b0323af56f3f1e75d85f038a8dec4c39_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So again recall when I posed this question to most of our students， the very
    first thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they ask is this product will cannibalize。 So we look at all these three very
    carefully as we go forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with the first one， the $2 million advertising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What kind of analysis can the team do to either justify it or to realize whether
    it's worthwhile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or not？ We do this in a very simple way。 We ask ourselves how much money do
    we make per lens？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well the answer is we make 40 cents per lens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/b0323af56f3f1e75d85f038a8dec4c39_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Again remember it's 65 cents minus 25 cents is 40 cents。 So each lens we sell
    we will make 40 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are planning to spend $2 million in advertising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So $2 million divided by 40 cents is 5 million lenses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means we will have to sell 5 million more lenses in order to be able to
    justify。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a $2 million expense on advertising。 That's a nice analysis but I don't think
    it's good enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make it even better I think you need to translate this into not lenses as
    the denominator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but again consumers as the denominator。 So if we translate it into consumers
    as the denominator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: each consumer lets assume if， we can get them stays with us for about a year
    in which year they will consume about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 730 lenses so 5 million divided by 730 is 6，849 new users。 What does that mean？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The $2 million of advertising will pay off if we can get 6，849 new users。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This I believe is a better way to present your results rather than saying I
    need to sell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5 million more lenses。 Advertising does not affect lenses it affects users。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again keep in mind the choice of the denominator when you justify your recommendations
    to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: committee， to the senior management。 Try to use the right denominator it helps
    you convey your message better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is break even of type 1 which is you are thinking of spending some money
    on advertising。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar analysis can be done if these two million were to be spent on advertising
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: improve the quality of the product how much more we would have to sell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's go to the next type of break even analysis which is reducing price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we considered this case earlier if Wisticon wanted to have equal margins
    to both the ECPs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well as themselves they would have to reduce the whole sale price from 65
    cents to 54 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the question then we ask ourselves is that's great it will make our ECPs
    happier but how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much more will we have to sell if we reduce the price from 65 cents to 54 cents
    and how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would we analyze that。 Let's do this slowly step by step。 At 65 cents our margin
    is 40 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why 65 minus 25 is 40 cents。 If we are proposing a new wholesale price of 54
    cents our margin will be 29 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we get 29 cents？ How much more we would have to sell at a margin of 29
    cents relative to a margin of 40 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to break even。 What we have to think about this is the following。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's suppose we were selling 100 lenses at 40 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much money we would make it will be 100 times 40 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the question is how much do we have to sell at 29 cents to break even。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that will be 100 times 40 is equal to this unknown number times 29 cents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is this unknown number it will be 100 times 40 divided by 29 which is
    137。9 which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: means we need a 37。9% increase in unit sales for us to break even if we are
    thinking of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lowering the price from 65 cents to 54 cents。 The next question is is this possible。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is we need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to increase our unit sales by 200 percent。 Then maybe there is no need to probe
    further because you know from past experience that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is unlikely to happen。 So this break even analysis gives you some interesting
    guidelines of what to do next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and also helps us rule out some really dominated alternatives in certain cases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's look at the third type of break even analysis which is what we call
    as cannibalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: break even。 Whenever cannibalization is often the first comment that comes up
    whenever we ask the question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in this particular case or other cases when a company is adding a new product
    to the product， line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now reflect back is cannibalization really a concern in this case？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's truly not because in this particular case this new product gives us $292
    per customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whereas the previous ones were giving us either 208 or 104。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So cannibalization is really not an issue here why because we would like all
    our customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to move from a product that gives us $104 per customer to $292 per customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So even though early on this is the first comment that comes up when you think
    a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit deeply cannibalization is really not a concern for daily disposables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But for us to study the concept of cannibalization which we'd like to do because
    it's an important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: concept let's look at another event from this very case study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This company at some point in time launched SureView when it already had AccuView
    on the， market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's use that as an example。 AccuView gives us $208 per customer whereas
    SureView gives us 104。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do I know what level of cannibalization can I tolerate from SureView before
    it becomes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unprofitable？ How do we think through this carefully？ So this is one way to
    consider this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say we have a sample of 100 customers who are currently buying SureView。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have them in front of us。 How much money are we making from these customers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the answer is 100 times 104。 Why 104？ Because they are buying SureView。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say we ask each of these customers what were they buying before they bought
    SureView。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we go one by one。 Let's say we do this hypothetical exercise where we ask
    each one of them what were they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: buying before they bought SureView。 And the first one says I was buying AccuView。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second one says I was buying AccuView。 The third one says I was buying I
    was using glasses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the maximum number of AccuViews we can hear before we say SureView is
    not profitable？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words， what is the maximum draw SureView can have from AccuView before
    we deem it unprofitable？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's call this number max。 Then how do we arrive at this max number？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much are we making today from these 100 customers？ It's 100 times 104。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SureView to be profitable this 100 times 104 has to be greater than this max
    we can tolerate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: times 208。 Why 208？ Because these people were earlier buying AccuView and we
    were making 208 dollars from each one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of them。 So the max has to be less than 100 times 104 divided by 208 which is
    50。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means we can at most tolerate 50% cannibalization from AccuView if we were
    launching SureView。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the cannibalization is more than 50 then SureView is going to lead to lower
    profits。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because it's drawing more customers from AccuView than we can handle。 Exactly
    at 50 it's equal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now let's put this in some perspective。 More generally than break even cannibalization
    is equal to the margin on the new product divided。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the margin on the existing product。 In this particular case it's 104 divided
    by 208 which is 50%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's ask another question。 What if we have more than one product？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this particular case the company just had AccuView and they are launching
    SureView。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What should we use in the denominator if we have more than one product？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One possible answer is we can use the weighted margin on existing products in
    the denominator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's an approximation but it's a good enough approximation is better than
    using one product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's reflect back on what we have covered in this lecture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We covered margin or contribution analysis and in this particular case the one
    thing I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do not want you to forget is remember the importance of the denominator。 We
    have finance people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accounting people who spend a lot of time and a lot of effort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in precisely determining what the numerator is。 Is it 208 dollars？ Is it 209
    dollars？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it 42 cents？ Is 43 cents？ But if you have the denominator wrong everything
    else is wrong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why does the retailer use dollars per square foot of shell space and why does
    the consulting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company use dollars per consultant are？ They use it because that is their critical
    resource for the retailer the critical resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shell space and for the consultant it's consultant hours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So make sure you have the denominator right。 Just look at this example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    disposable。

    products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come from the same brand。 So these analysis margin analysis and break even analysis
    help us make better pricing decisions。
  prefs: []
