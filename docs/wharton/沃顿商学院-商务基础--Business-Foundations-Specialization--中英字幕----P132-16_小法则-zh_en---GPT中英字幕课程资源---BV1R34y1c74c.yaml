  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To illustrate the equation and to build some intuition， I will use a hospital
    example。 A while ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the interventional radiologists here at Penn had asked me to look at
    their， patient flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    shut。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    shows up。 And at 8。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Sharp as you are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    onwards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in 15 minutes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of our day in the hospital， we have built graphs that look something
    like， this。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    outflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In prior modules we refer to this number as a flow rate which I am going to
    now abbreviate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the letter R。 The flow rate measures how many patients we saw in a given
    period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of time in our case one day。 There are a couple of more things this graph teaches
    us about the patient flow。
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: abbreviate with the letter I。 Finally， you can also see how long a patient spent
    in the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and out much faster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flow time measures how long it took for the patient to flow through the
    process from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: beginning to end。 Now the reason why I'm reviewing these three definitions here
    is not just because they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are important。 If you look at the figure here which summarizes all observations
    for the day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might see， your relationship。 On average， the inventory in the process is
    a flow rate in the process times the flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time。 Inventory in this case is measured in patients。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Flow rate is patients per hour and flow time is measured in hours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any process and at any time the average inventory is equal to the average
    flow rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: times the average flow time or I equals R times T for short。

- en: We will refer to this relationship as Little's Law。 You see a picture of Mr。
    John Little here。 Dr。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Little was born in 1928 but more importantly， his law says on average in any
    process inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is equal to flow rate times flow time。 I've been teaching this for many， many
    years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In one of my classes a student had a great idea how to remember the equation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He just stared at my slide and shouted out， "I R T。 I remember that。 I can't
    beat that。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More importantly， let's talk about the implications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Little's law reminds us that from the three most important performance measure
    in any， process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two you can potentially mess around with and adjust but once you have done this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the third one is really given by nature。 Well， there's an easy way to get to
    zero inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You just stop producing。 You said R equals zero and you get I equals zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But obviously that's a really bad idea。 So if you want to get rid of some working
    capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get rid of some inventory， the only， way you can do this is to move the flow
    units faster through the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to remember that flow time and inventory holding flow rate constant
    move proportional。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to each other。 This is also practically very helpful。 Oftentimes when you do
    a process analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say you visit a plant， you might only be able， to see to observe two of the
    three performance measures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using little's law， you can just compute yourself the third one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which of the three performance measures， IR and T， do you think is the hardest
    one to。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: compute and practice？ Well， let's think about that。 Does a company know its
    flow rate？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How many tables it has made？ How many loans it has under it？ Or how many patients
    it has seen？ Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even fairly incompetent companies measure their flow rate。 After all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flow rate times price equal to revenue。 Do they know their inventory？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this oftentimes is tracked less carefully in the services world in manufacturing
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: retailing where you typically are dealing with physical products as flow units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to track your inventory for accounting purposes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In servers that is oftentimes not done as carefully but still hospitals tend
    to know how many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: patients they have。 This number is oftentimes called the census。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Banks or insurance sometimes track the customers that are waiting for a loan
    as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a flow time that is oftentimes forgotten or hard to measure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How long did I have to wait in line？ How long has this customer waited for her
    request？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To say it with Benjamin Franklin's words， lost time is never found again。 Wise
    words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so I doubt that good old band have the ideal flow time in mind。 Anyway， the
    good news is this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can always find the average flow time as long as you have the average inventory
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the average flow rate。 In the next videos， we will put little law to work。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
