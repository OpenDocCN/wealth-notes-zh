  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: There's really just going to be two key themes。 The first theme is how do channels
    of distribution develop the structure that they do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So who is doing what， who's getting the product to the end consumer。 And then
    secondly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    places full of conflict。

    only sell tied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But of course， Walmart wants to have a lot of variety on the shelf。 Why is that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because not everyone wants to buy tied， people want choice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so oftentimes in a channel of distribution， there is inherent conflict。

  prefs: []

    I think about distribution or place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We call place sometimes the final frontier， the final P。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oftentimes people don't think about distribution as a way to innovate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I think they really should， and here's some reasons why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So distribution can really be an important source of sustainable competitive
    advantage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_10.png)'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the customer。

    decisions can be sort of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long lived and difficult ones。 If you build physical distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's going to cost you some money to do so， so you need to really be sure about
    the return that you're going to get。

- en: Now， as I said earlier， I think distribution is often overlooked， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also it's a place where there could be tremendous value unlocked in terms of
    new， business ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: new services and new products coming into play。 So think about the way that
    you can change the nature of the distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: channel by taking a hard good and turning it into a soft good。 Let me give you
    an example of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when money is money and only cash， there are certain things you can do with
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when money becomes credit or when money becomes available on your mobile，
    phone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that really frees up the way people can transact。 If you think about a movie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: innovation and distribution， that can really change the nature of markets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even what we're doing now through our Coursera class is kind of an example of，
    this。 Normally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Coursera course， or the marketing course that Barbara and， Pete and I teach
    together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would be taught in a physical facility at the Wharton。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: School to a limited audience in a particular time。 Now， of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it can be taught to a much broader audience and， we're really happy about that。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And also， it can be taught at any time。 You guys can be watching these videos
    as many times as you like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first thing we're going to do in customer access and distribution is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about the structure of the channel and who the key players are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And the most basic thing to think about here is whether a channel is direct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning that the provider of the good or service is going straight to the end
    user。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: or whether or not there are some intermediaries or layers involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's look at this example on the slide of the American Hospital Supply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Company to kind of illustrate why sometimes it can be efficient to place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an intermediary between the producer of a good or service and the end user。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's imagine we have a market with three manufacturers on the left hand
    side， the three squares。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and three consumers indicated by the three circles。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if every manufacturer had to sell individually to every consumer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that would be a possibility of three by three or nine different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combinations of buying and selling or， transacting occurring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as Barbara spoke about in the very first sessions。 On the other side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imagine now that a distributor or， middle person comes into this market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are still three manufacturers and， three consumers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but now the three manufacturers just sell their product to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the distributor and the three consumers just visit the distributor or the retailer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now there are only six possible interactions。 So by adding a distributor
    to a channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: creating an indirect channel， I dramatically reduced the number of transactions。
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: probably not dramatically in this example， but if you look below the line， it's
    certainly dramatic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So American hospital supply found that it could reduce the total number of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transactions that will be needed in this market from 850 million by aggregating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: down to only about 100，000。 It's still a lot， but it's a huge reduction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_26.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So that's the economic theory of why an indirect channel is sometimes preferred。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over a direct channel because it reduces the total number of transactions that
    are required。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_28.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So again， there are some efficiency advantages of having an indirect channel，
    over a direct channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However， there are other advantages of going direct。 What might some of those
    reasons be？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I go direct to the end customer， I might create a special kind of barrier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to entry for others in that market。 So now for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that Apple as a manufacturer goes direct to its end customers， through its own
    retail store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: makes it difficult for other sellers of hardware and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: related software to do the same thing or to do it just as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason for going direct is you get sometimes much better feedback from，
    the market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have to rely on some intermediary to tell you what customers really like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what variety and what prices， they may be unwilling to do so。 So by going direct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can kind of go around or cut out the middleman。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third thing that you can do is you can sometimes bundle other goods or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: services more efficiently， higher margin products。 So if I go into the Apple
    store to buy an iPhone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe they can also sell me a laptop， and some other devices while I'm in there
    because now the manufacturer is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: controlling that channel and going direct to the end consumer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I'm showing here now is a diagram that kind of explains in graphical
    form。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of the things that happen in a channel of distribution， all of the various
    flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that have to take place。 This is a pretty long channel of distribution， as you
    can see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going all the， way from the supplier of the good and service on one side， all
    the way to the end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer on the other side。 So here are the five things that have to happen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is an interesting diagram because it also helps you understand how
    this flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can be disrupted。 So first of all， physical product has to move from the supplier
    all the way down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the end user。 Secondly， sometimes there's a flow of title or ownership。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course there's a flow of payment， sometimes how the end user has to send。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the payment back to the supplier。 And then of course there is information and
    promotional flows as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I want us to think about here is in a channel of distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are players who are responsible for the flow of both goods and information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So as you look at this chart， I'd encourage you in your own time to think about
    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the channel of distribution could be disrupted in a way that's very， very innovative
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_32.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: might lead to a new business。 So let's look at the one on the top。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is the physical flow of goods and services。 And let's relate that back
    to our course case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quidsee。com。 So how do quidsee change or disrupt this existing channel of distribution？
    Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the prequidsee days， if I wanted to buy some detergent， I had to go to a
    supermarket。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who'd received that product from a manufacturer via warehouses and distributors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pick it up myself and take it home。 What quidsee did is innovating on the delivery
    to end customers by sending that product via。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_34.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Federal Express or UPS directly to my home。 We're seeing of course increased
    innovation in this area too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as companies like eBay， Google， Amazon and so on， are figuring out ways to either
    send things directly to a home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if they're physical goods and services， or perhaps send them to intermediary
    places。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like existing stores where there are lockboxes and we can then go and pick them
    up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same thing also applies for services， not just for physical products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about the process whereby in the old days you might want to book a hotel
    if you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were going to New York City for a vacation。 You might have to call a travel
    agency or even go to the hotel website and find out if the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product was available or call somebody。 Now of course that's been disrupted
    by apps such as Hotel Tonight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can just go onto an app。 You can see all of the hotels in New York City
    where you can stay for one night at whatever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the rate is for a single night and you can just book directly on your mobile
    phone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_36.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So again， this is a very， very interesting chart because I'm sure as you go
    through you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can think of ways that this system can be disrupted either for information or
    for physical goods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_38.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: or for title and so on。 One other example I think is an old one but very， very
    instructive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you go back to what Michael Dowled did way back in the 1990s， he realized
    that there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was a physical flow of computers where the manufacturers like Hewlett Packard
    and IBM。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on sold into distributors and the product eventually ended up on the
    shelf and computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stores where Chris， my friend and I would go shopping and we would talk to a
    sales person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amy who would tell us what we needed and so on。 So a very long complicated channel
    involving people handling inventory and everything else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a certain point Michael Dowled realized well people know enough about computers
    now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to order them directly on their own。 They can call 1-800-DOWL。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can make it and customize it and ship it directly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I can't really stress enough that distribution is a tremendous source of
    advantage of new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_40.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: business ideas and also of leverage。 I'll just give one more example just so
    you can think about this in simple terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To complement the previous chart， think about distribution channels as providing
    flows for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: physical things and for information things。 So what do I mean by this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the distribution channel might be required to establish an assortment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might be required to deliver things， to do installation and repair。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those are all physical things that need to be done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The distribution channel also needs to provide information to understand what
    customers want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generate leads， procure market feedback and so forth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So almost everything that's done in a distribution channel is some combination
    of a physical flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and also an information flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_42.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So now what I'd like to do is to share with you a very useful tool or a very
    useful framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for understanding how a distribution channel actually functions in terms of
    the activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that need to be done。 It's called a hybrid grid。 A hybrid grid is just simply
    a matrix。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know you learned a lot about various matrices from Pete。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the same idea in a different context。 So the columns of our matrix are
    going to be the activities that need to be performed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everything， from generating initial leads all the way through to the sale of
    the product or service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then potentially even after sale。 The rows are going to be the individuals
    or entities who will be responsible for performing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these various tasks。 And the idea is you want to construct a system of distribution
    that's optimized for the customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you're trying to reach。 You want the exact right person to be performing
    the exact right customer such that the channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: operates efficiently and smoothly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_44.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So the example I'm going to give is interesting products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's actually a business-to-business product sold to farmers。 It's called BGH。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a bovine growth hormone。 I'm not suggesting that you should buy any of
    this but I'm going to show you how it works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of the hybrid grid。 So the marketing challenges for the company Monsanto
    who produced this product were multiple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular they had four things they really had to worry about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how could they educate farmers that this was a good thing to use on their
    herd？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How could they assure quality？ How could they make sure that the farmers were
    using it correctly？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then also how could they recycle and take care of use syringes and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the question was who on earth is going to do what？ So now let me show you
    this by way of a chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again you can see from the left to the right in the columns are all of the activities
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: need to be performed。 Everything from generating awareness all the way through
    to monitoring that the vets and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the farmers are actually using the product appropriately。 On the columns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sorry on the rows we see all of the entities or individuals who are responsible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for various activities。 And where I blued in the square the idea is this is
    the optimal combination of activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and person who's performing it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_46.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And the way you figure out the optimal combination is to figure out two things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all who's best at doing this from a customer point of view and secondly
    who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is going to get the compensation or the rewards for doing so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96bae4d5de0479a1e43c7a8a155911f1_48.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So if we start for example with generating awareness and interest that is a
    task that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was going to fall to the agency， outbound telemarketing and also Monsanto sales
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's not something that local vets are probably going to be motivated to do
    unless they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to be somehow compensated for doing that。 So the idea is it's the personal
    entity that's best at doing it and also the personal entity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
