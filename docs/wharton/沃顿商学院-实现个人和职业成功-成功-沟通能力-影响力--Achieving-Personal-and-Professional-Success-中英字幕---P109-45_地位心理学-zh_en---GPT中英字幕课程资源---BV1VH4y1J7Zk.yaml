  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: psychology。 We're going to use a review paper in 2003 by Doc Keltner and a couple
    of his colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the determinants of power。 But really we want to jump to the end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to talk about the social consequences of power。 So let me just unpack
    those for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This research has been done in the lab and outside of the lab。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very often they are running experiments。 Just Keltner is just one of the researchers
    in this area。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but one of the most prominent。 But the people working in this field。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they run experiments where they manipulate whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a person is in a high power situation or a low power situation so they can really
    isolate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the impact of power directly。 Some of the studies are field studies where they
    just assess。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They determine independently whether someone is in a high power or low power
    situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what they have found， let's run through a quick summary here， elevated power
    increases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and reduced power increases。 The experience and expression of positive affect
    whereas reduced power increases the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experience and expression of negative affect。 So power is making people happier
    and facilitates the expression of that happiness and vice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: versa for reduced power。 Elevated power increases sensitivity to rewards where
    reduced power increases sensitivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to threat and punishment。 So you can imagine this has direct consequences for
    how people act。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If one is only focused on the upside that might lead for example to more risk
    taking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If one is disproportionately focused on the downside， the threats and the punishment，
    that's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to lead to a great deal of risk aversion。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: elevated power increases the tendency to construe others as a means to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an end where reduced power increases the tendency to see yourself as means of
    somebody else's， end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So kind of profound psychological shifts as we increase power or have our power
    reduced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Elevated power increases automatic social cognition。 This is for example the
    use of stereotypes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's reasoning about people kind of top down from our schemas， from our stereotypes，
    from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our categories， reasoning down to the individuals whereas reduced power increases
    controlled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: social cognition。 So it's reasoning up from the details of the situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example they have studied this and looking at applicants to a school
    or to a committee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they've coded how people reason about those applicants and when they're
    induced to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be in a high power situation they're more apt to use these social categories
    and stereotypes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as a reason about the applicants。 Power increases approach related behavior
    whereas reduced power increases behavioral。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inhibition。 So what is approach related behavior？ This can be attitudes and
    behavior on food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: physical space， verbal and nonverbal sex。 Sex in these studies is usually some
    kind of flirtatious behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But for example people use physical space very differently when they are in
    high power situations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than when they're in low。 In the classroom we ask people， okay give us a little
    demonstration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But as people would sit if they had low power and you see a whole classroom
    of kids they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get all scrum stuff like this and they bend over and then you say okay alternatively
    sit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as you would if you're really feeling powerful。 And people start leaning back
    and spreading out and invariably somebody would put their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feet up on the desk。 There'll be knocking other people stuff out of the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is what's been， this is what's been observed in field settings and
    in experimental。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: settings people take up space very differently when they're feeling high power
    or they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feeling low power and this is connected to this idea of approach related behavior
    versus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: behavioral inhibition。 When you have， when you're in a high power situation
    you're more approach related。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People when they have higher power the experience of power increases consistent
    and coherent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: social behavior whereas reduced power increases situationally contingent behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means when you're feeling more powerful you're more the same across a wide
    range of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: situations than when you're not feeling powerful。 When you're not feeling powerful
    you're completely pushed around by the situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your situation， your behavior is situationally contingent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as we get to this point on the slide you begin to realize these consequences
    aren't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all bad right。 Because who do you want to be？ Do you want to be the person who
    is the same in every situation or do you want to be the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: person who gets pushed around by all these various situations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Love truthfully you probably need to be somewhere in the middle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've all had friends or colleagues or bosses who were a little bit too much
    the same person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in all situations。 They probably could have tailored it a little bit better
    to the situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand you don't want to be someone who is completely malleable by
    the situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it begins giving us a sense that some of this power leads to behavior that
    is good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and probably advantageous to us。 Too much of it leads to behavior that can be
    damaging to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally， the elevated power increases the likelihood of socially inappropriate
    behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example interrupting， speaking out of turn， impolite eating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the lab they've gone as far as coding the code things like how often people
    talk， over people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They code things like how much they chew with their mouth open， how many crumbs
    fall when， they eat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've gotten very precise and the results are always in the same direction
    that increased。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: power leads to these socially inappropriate behaviors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So more recently Keltoner in his book The Power Paradox finds four themes in
    this literature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Four consequences of power。 One is what he calls empathy deficits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have a harder time empathizing with other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have a harder time even understanding the emotions they are experiencing
    when we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in high power situations。 We have more self-serving impulsivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You've just seen examples of that in some of the experiments I cited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have more incivility and disrespect the talking over， the demands， the bad
    language。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the criticism。 And we have what he calls narratives of exceptionalism。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are amazingly resourceful in rationalizing why we deserve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After all we've accomplished and all the work we've put in to act impossibly
    unethical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact it's not even unethical because we deserve it。 We're entitled。 We are
    exceptional。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are the themes that Keltoner has seen given another 12 or 13 years on
    his research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's even a simpler theme and that is the common thread of disinhibition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one way of making sense of all the behaviors that we've just talked
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Increased power leads to acting on desires in a social context without concern
    for social。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consequences。 So again some of this is probably a good thing right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the problem of having too much。 It's the problem of a little power is good
    but a lot of power feeling the status becomes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a bad thing。 I would probably wish for most of my friends and students a little
    less inhibition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A little more disinhibition until they have too much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what we see is power leads people to be more reward focused， more sensitive
    to their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: internal states， reduce sensitivity to other people's needs， more action orientation
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: general being more instrumental。 All of this comes from being more disinhibited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be even a little bit more provocative and underscore this disinhibition idea
    some colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hirsch， Kielinski and Jean studied disinhibition in a few different ways and
    they found that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way people act when they are in powerful situations is related to the way
    they act when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're in anonymous situations or when they're drunk。

    understand the connections。
