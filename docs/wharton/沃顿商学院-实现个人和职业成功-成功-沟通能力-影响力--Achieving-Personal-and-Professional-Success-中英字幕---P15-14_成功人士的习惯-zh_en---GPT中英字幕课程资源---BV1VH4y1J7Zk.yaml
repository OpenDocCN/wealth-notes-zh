    tend to have。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one habit that people who have this combination going for them tend to have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that they are spontaneously excited， enthusiastic and they are people who
    tend to learn from the mistakes they make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    life。
  prefs: []

    the mistake。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to be the first child who couldn't ever learn to walk。
  prefs: []

    up and then he stumbled across and fell on his face。

    a child has when they are learning to walk。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    achievements and it means that they can be resilient。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you know that your excitement will take you forward。
  prefs: []

    when it occurs。

    quo。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have combined this inner and outer dimension in certain ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the first is their kind of resiliency and their excitement and their ability
    to get up when they fall down。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    make their own lives better。

    to talk about next。
