- en: Let's talk about what this thing looks like when the rubber meets the road。
    How do you act on it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What might you do with it？ To do that， consider a few example assignments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: This is something that most people have knee-jerk reactions against for the
    obvious reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but give it a little bit more thought。 Give it especially thought。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: given what we just talked through。 Why might you want a desk by the bathroom？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What might be the benefits of a desk by the bathroom？ Well， clearly everybody's
    going to come by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: basically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: opportunity to interact with。 That's the basic idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we can generalize from a desk by the bathroom to a desk in a busy area，
    to a desk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where people are often coming。 I've had people who spent interns， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in organizations where they happen to sit next， to the boss， the big boss。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they had access to executives that they never would have had access to。
    And as a result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got full-time jobs just because of where they sat in their internship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've observed my colleagues in various faculties over the years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And some choose to sit at the ends of Hall， where it's a little quieter， maybe
    a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit more space， maybe the view is leafier， and those who sit on the main corridor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have to put up with a little more noise， but they're much more in the flow
    of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the research would suggest that's going to put them a little bit better
    footing and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in thicker position with more of their colleagues and more of their relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's a way of thinking about an opportunity you might not have taken otherwise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are some other ones。 So what about an overseas assignment？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/fa4151b1f4bcb3350b1e79c0d8b6c9c1_9.png)'
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: You might be forgotten。 You move from headquarters to the field。 People get
    busy at headquarters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They might forget about you。 There's always that risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the benefits of an overseas assignment？ Well you start bridging these
    structural holes in a way that you can't if you're back in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: staff and you're back in headquarters。 You meet entirely new set of people and
    you have a chance to create those relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a way that you wouldn't have had you only visited for a day or you only talked
    by email。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing an overseas assignment does， it guarantees that you'll be in
    the spinner。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: again when you come off of that thing。 They've got to put you somewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you'll be considered again for another spot as you roll off of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Trade-offs but if you bring this structural holes idea and the need for diverse
    networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to it you might lean a different direction。 Finally， what about a seat on a
    task force？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Boss comes or maybe someone who's driving your boss and says you want to be
    on a committee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got room to be on a committee。 This is not something most of us look forward
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of us have all the work we need。 Don't need more committees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my experience there is no better way to get to know people in a diverse part
    of your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organization， a new part of your organization than to work on a committee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn't mean you need to go load up and be on three or four of them but my
    best relationships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with people from outside my department for example have come from one of two
    places。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Either I office across the hall from them randomly as we talked about with the
    desk by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the bathroom or I was on some kind of interdisciplinary task force with them
    and I worked together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with them， could have been for a month， it could have been for a year in a way
    that I wouldn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have had an opportunity to do so otherwise。 I host a radio show here on Sirius
    XM。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of our business radio shows and there are four， of us， one from the marketing
    department。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two from the staff department and me from our， operations， information and decisions
    department。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I knew one of these guys before we started。 Now three years in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are three of my closest colleagues on faculty。 I never would have had
    that closest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I never would have had that time with them had we not done this committee， this
    task force。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: together。 So something to think about again， hopefully you'll think about these
    decisions differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because of this framework。 The framework the Burt and Granovetter and the whole
    field of sociology have given us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a very parsimonious one， two parsimonious in some ways but it might push
    you to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decisions differently if you take it seriously。 So there are trade-offs here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're acknowledging the trade-offs， we're just pushing you a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit to think about considering the uncomfortable thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We had these inclinations to do the comfortable thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go back to the seating assignment discussion at the top of the module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The comfortable thing when you walk into a room deciding where to sit for dinner
    or to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sign up on a registration for a conference dinner is to find your friends and
    sit down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's human and that's understandable。 If you understand though the returns
    to social network that includes diverse ties that is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little bit less connected， a little bit less dense then you'll start leaning
    against that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comfortable thing and that's what we want to do today really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We just want to push you to be a little bit less comfortable， a little less
    automatic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and intuitive in your decisions about where you sit， what assignments you take。
    Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: give you a couple of empirical observations。 One neat one comes from Adam Kleinbaum。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he did this as part of his dissertation in grad， school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was one of the very first sociologists to look at email as a source of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/fa4151b1f4bcb3350b1e79c0d8b6c9c1_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now tons of people do this， it's become very common， it's very interesting research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/fa4151b1f4bcb3350b1e79c0d8b6c9c1_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: He was one of the first。 He went into a large information technology company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they had 30 product divisions， global， presence and he sampled all email activity
    for 30。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 employees for a three month period， of time。 What do you think you found？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's a picture and it shows traffic， email traffic between divisions and what
    this is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: showing is essentially all the traffic， whatever the percentage is， 95 plus
    98 percent of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: traffic is on the diagonal meaning from one division to the same division。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's all within division traffic。 Barely anybody is talking to people in other
    divisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/fa4151b1f4bcb3350b1e79c0d8b6c9c1_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This is a huge opportunity for you。 This is a way of differentiating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're the person in the organization who actually has relationships in these
    other， divisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: communicates with people in these other divisions， you're going to have an information。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: advantage that other people don't have。 Another way of looking at this and this
    is increasingly what people are doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bringing， this idea beyond traditional networks and looking for the benefits
    of diversity and other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kinds of networks。 A few researchers recently published a piece in the MIT Sloan
    Management Review on a study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they did of Twitter users and how innovative those Twitter users are compared
    to people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who don't use Twitter and then most interestingly how innovative they are as
    a function of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: type of Twitter network they have。 In particular they used organizational network
    analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the kind of structures that we've， been looking at in the last few lectures
    at 10 work groups and five different organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very different organizations， consulting group， a manufacturing firm， consumer
    food group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and higher ed and ask can we see any differences in how innovative an employee
    is as a function。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the kind of network they have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In this case we're talking about Twitter network。 So here is a picture of two
    employees that they looked at and different Twitter networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the employee A， the one on the left had a Twitter network that they characterize
    as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relatively disconnected。 Most of the people they're following on Twitter don't
    follow each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some do of course but mostly they don't。 Contrast that with employee B whose
    Twitter network is highly dense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: highly connected。 These people that Twitter， that employee B is following actually
    follow each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is the consequence of that？ How would you interpret that in light of
    what we talked about with structural holes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/fa4151b1f4bcb3350b1e79c0d8b6c9c1_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Burt and Granite bedroom。 Clearly employee A is tapping into more information
    and more different kinds of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interestingly what they found is when they looked at how innovative the employee
    was at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work they found those with more diverse Twitter networks submitted more interesting
    ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that were rated higher quality essentially more innovative ideas than employees
    whose Twitter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: networks were denser， more connected to each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are more and more examples like this where this principle of diversity
    and networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being a benefit is tested and found in more and more interesting places。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going beyond the traditional organizational analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in general this structural hole brokerage thesis what does it say？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It says we place a premium on non-redundant diverse context that there are significant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: returns to knowledge about what others networks look like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you understand and perceive others networks you have an advantage because
    you can tap into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those that are you can strategically choose to be affiliated with those who
    offer new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more diverse information。 And then finally it plays down the importance of key
    contacts knowing the right person。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This is kind of the conventional wisdom is you got to know the right person
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you put yourself in the better places and networks you're going to increase
    the likelihood。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of information coming through about those people meeting more people meeting
    people you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wouldn't meet otherwise。 And in general again to emphasize this is all about
    non-redundant diverse contacts in all。
  prefs: []
