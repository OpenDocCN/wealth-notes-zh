  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what Wagner Dodge also discovered when he got close to the fire doing his
    due diligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: good that he found this out is that the material on the ground is very dry，
    very thick， very。

    as he circled。

    harm's way。

    my question。
