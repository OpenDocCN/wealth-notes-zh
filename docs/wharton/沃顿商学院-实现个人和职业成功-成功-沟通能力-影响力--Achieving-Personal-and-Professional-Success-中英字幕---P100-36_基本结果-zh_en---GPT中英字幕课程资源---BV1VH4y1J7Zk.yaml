- en: We've been collecting these for almost 10 years now with MBAs， executive MBAs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some executive ed students， and we can make some sense of it now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it'll help you make sense of your results。 To begin with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's remember that the response scale for these is behavioral and， it's about
    frequency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how often you do each of these things。 So the response scale is from one to
    four， rarely or never。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to almost always。 And again， we have four to six questions， behaviors that add
    up to the score for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: each of these 12 tactics。 So the report looks something like this where we've
    listed the tactics along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Y axis from allocentrism down to ethos。 And then we've reported your result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your frequency along the X axis from rarely to， always。 The first is your self
    assessment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are your scores according to the four to six items for each of these behaviors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second piece here is the class average or the benchmark， whatever benchmark
    we happen to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it might have been the MBAs or the executive MBAs or， the participants in
    this MOOC。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's some benchmark。 So the intention here is to kind of， this is a self
    assessment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's kind of like putting a mirror up in front of you and saying， hey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is what you think is going on。 And yet we're going to put it in the language
    of the theory and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the literature and give you a framework for thinking about it so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that if you do want to change these， dial something up， dial something back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll you can think about it in a more focused way。 We sometimes do more than
    just self assessment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes we assess people's behaviors with a group of folks they've worked
    with， bosses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: subordinates， peers， we call these 360 evaluations or third party evaluations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we've learned some over time about how the third party evaluations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relate to the self assessments。 You have the self assessment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we thought we might share with you a little bit about， what the third parties
    look like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big picture is they're highly correlated。 The correlations across all 12
    are on average or something like 0。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 57。 Most of the classes we do we see between 0。5 and 0。6。 Correlation between
    the scales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the scale averages for， self assessments versus the scale averages for 360s。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are the summaries for a pretty large sample hundreds of students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see that the self assessments lie below the third party assessments
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: almost every tactic。 And this is this kind of wrinkle we see with every population
    where people report。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing fewer of these things or doing them less frequently。 Then do 360 raters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the third party raters who sometimes provide surveys to us。 So we don't know
    what truth is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't know whether people are doing more of these things than just not aware
    of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or that people believe or infer that others are doing them more than they actually
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we do see a little bit of a bias。 So you could rest assured that the odds
    are if you had 360 raters that you would have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little bit higher scores across the board。 Some of these are， deltas are bigger
    than others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， on exchange， there's not much of a bias。 On allocentrism， not
    much of a bias。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that these are behaviors that are a little bit more observable。 On intentionality，
    for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the gap is higher。 On might， the gap is a little bit higher。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you might use this to add little context and adjust or imagine what the results
    would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be like if we ask your peers and bosses and subordinates to rate you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might wonder about differences between men and women。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certainly my students often ask me this question。 So here's one sample， one
    year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have 108 people in this sample。 These are means across the 12。 And what you
    see is broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are no differences。 So where we do see differences， there are the stereotypical
    differences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， on might， men are rated as exercising might a little more frequently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than women are。 On allocentrism， the opposite。 Women are rated as exercising
    allocentrism。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this understanding of others， trying to understand， others a little more how
    to be men are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8ce190ed995fd50211b83e4123348ca1_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This is kind of consistent with this stereotype， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which underlines the fact that we don't know what truth is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't know for a fact what they're actually doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be that the ratings are just being consistent with stereotypes。 But
    the big picture is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe to a surprising extent， that behaviors are rated similarly， across the
    sexes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Men and women aren't seen as acting that differently， at least in the MBA and
    executive MBA samples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we've primarily collected。 Now we've talked so far in terms of 12 tactics
    and we built the survey around those 12 tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's where the theory is。 But it could be that we can talk about it in a simpler
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can kind of aggregate those。 One way to aggregate them is think about hard
    power and soft power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So traditionally people have talked about power in these ways。 For millennia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they talked about one way of one form of power， hard power， military might，
    the economic might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More recently， mostly because of Joseph Nye， people started talking about soft
    power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Nye has a quote here from The Economist。 He was certainly writing about this
    before then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in this piece， right after 9/11， Nye writes， "Throughout history， coalitions
    of countries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have arisen to balance dominant powers and the search for traditional shifts
    in the balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of power and new state challengers is underway。"， While potential coalitions
    to check American power could be created。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's unlikely they'd， become firm alliances unless the US handles its hard course
    of power in an overbearing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unilateral manner that undermines its soft or attractive power， the important
    ability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to get others to want what you want。 So he was writing right on the heels of
    9/11。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: basically cautioning the US about how they， used hard power because it might
    impact their soft power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He had been talking for decades at this point about the impact of soft power，
    the importance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of soft power， the argument basically being that one of the reasons the US had
    been so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influential in the world in the 20th century was not just because of economic
    and military。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might but because of their soft power。 Other countries， other people wanted
    to be like the US。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So others have talked about it broadly this way。 The organizational scholar
    Jeff Pfeffer who has written a lot on power talks about some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: individual traits that are conducive to power and he organizes them in two buckets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He organizes them as the capacity to garner support and allies in this bucket。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He puts sensitivity to others flexibility and the ability to submerge your ego。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a second bucket is the ability to survive in a competitive arena。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this bucket he puts energy and physical stamina， focus， the ability to tolerate
    conflict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This looks a lot like hard power in the second bucket and soft power in the
    first bucket。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is clearly the way people have been thinking about power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might be able to divide our 12 tactics into that。 But we can also ask the
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the right way to simplify？ Maybe we can reduce from 12 down to 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or maybe we can reduce all the way down to 1。 Or maybe we shouldn't go that
    far。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe we should only reduce down to 3。 You can answer that question using a
    technique called factor analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a way to reduce the dimensionality of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can distill 12 or if we had 20 or 30 we could distill those down to maybe
    2 attributes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or 3 attributes。 This method will tell us how far down you can go before you
    start losing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before you start， throwing away information。 It will also help us identify key
    patterns in the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to use factor analysis to see can we simplify your report for
    you essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to remember 12 or can you distill it down to something less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what we find when we use factor analysis on these reports。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It tells us that there are three factors in the data and this has been robust
    across a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: number of samples at this point。 A factor is basically a weighted average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's going to take each of these 12 tactics and it's going to give each tactic
    a certain， weight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A tactic might have a lot of weight for some factors and not much weight on
    another factor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are the weights for the three factors in our data。 So factor A。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: big weights on ethos and might， low weights， actually negative weights on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: alloscentrism and everything else is kind of in the middle。 Factor B， the middle
    factor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Big weights on team， networks， coalitions， pathos， exchange and alloscentrism。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A little bit on essay and agency but mostly it's those six kind of relationship
    tactics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the middle。 And on the third factor， factor C， we see most of the weight
    comes from these bottom four。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in tensionality， logos， situation awareness and agency。 So what does that look
    like？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things about factor analysis， it doesn't tell you what these things
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn't give you names for these things。 It just tells you what the weighted
    averages are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you look at the first， it looks a lot like hard power。 So we call it hard
    power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at the second， these are all these relationship tactics。 It looks
    a lot like soft power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we call it soft。 We were expecting those two。 The interesting bit is this
    third factor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is these three meta tools， intentionality， situation awareness and agency
    with the addition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of logos。 We didn't know that logos would necessarily travel with these other
    three but it does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we end up calling this smart power and we end up with these three factors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can distill your 12 down to three broader strategies。 Hard power， soft power
    and smart power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We borrowed the term again from Joseph Nye。 So this is more recent work from
    him in a book a few years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He published called The Future of Power。 He has a chapter on smart power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it was the first time we were exposed to the terminology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out the Obama administration had been talking about that for years。
    In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he quotes Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her confirmation hearings as
    saying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"You must use what has been called smart power。 The full range of tools at
    our disposal， diplomatic。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: economic， military， political， legal， and， cultural。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: picking the right tool or combination of tools for each situation。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8ce190ed995fd50211b83e4123348ca1_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So this fits very well with our notion of meta tools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it maps almost perfectly onto the three that we have in that bin that meta
    tool bin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then additionally our data say， "Well， you should also have logos in there，
    this logical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reasoning。"， So that is the first cut on our data and a description of the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in the next section we'll want to ask， "Okay， fine， but how does that relate
    to influence？"。
