  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hi everyone welcome back to Corporate Finance。 Today we're going to talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decision criteria but before doing so let's recap our previous lecture in which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we forecasted free cash flows。 Specifically we took our forecast drivers our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assumptions about what would happen in the future and applied them to generate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dollar forecasts of all of the components of the free cash flow formula which
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then built up aggregated into free cash flow forecasts。 Today we're going to
    turn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to what to do with those forecasts by looking at different decision criteria。
    So let's get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what do we do with our cash flows from last time？ One。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thing we can do is we can compute the NPV and I'm going to assume a discount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rate of 12% that is r equals 12% and if we do that and apply it to our free。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cash flows that we computed in the last lecture what we're going to see is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this project this tablet project has an NPV of 708。42 million dollars。 Not bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What that means is that firm value debt plus equity is going to increase by
    708。42。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: million dollars in expectation if the project is undertaken。 So from a decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making standpoint undertake the project。 That's what the NPV rule tells us。
    It says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accept all projects with a positive NPV， reject all projects with a negative
    NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and while this has boiled it down to one number I want to be careful especially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we start doing our sensitivity analysis to recognize that we don't want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pin all our hopes to that one number。 Now another thing we can do is we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compute the internal rate of return。 The internal rate of return of a project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recall is the one discount rate such that the net present value of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: project's free cash flow is equal zero。 We've actually already seen this when
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were talking about yields。 Remember the yield is the one discount rate such
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you discount the cash flows by the yield you get the price but the NPV
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nothing more than the price minus the present value of all the future cash，
    flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So IRR and yield are really one and the same。 So what's the IRR for this， project？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well we write our NPV formula we set our NPV equal to zero and then we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: solve for the one discount rate such that when we discount all of our free cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: flows we get an NPV of zero。 If we do that we find that the IRR on this project
    is， 43。7 percent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well is that good？ Is it bad？ Before getting there I just want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mention typically we're going to need to solve this numerically unless you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: figured out some amazing way to solve higher order polynomials。 You can use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the IRR function in Excel I think you can use goal seek in Excel you can try
    trial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and error though that's really inefficient if you're using another software
    program。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or a financial calculator you can do this as well。 So what is what do we do
    with， this 43。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7 percent IRR？ Well we're going to compare it to our cost of capital our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hurdle rate and what we're going to do is we're going to undertake the project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because the IRR is greater than the hurdle rate。 Intuitively it makes sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is one of those cases where intuition actually works。 It costs us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 12% to raise money in the capital markets to fund our investments to create
    value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this project generates a return of 43。7 percent that's substantially larger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than what it costs us to raise the funds。 That sounds good that makes sense
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so what the IRR rule says is accept all projects whose IRR is greater than R。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and reject all projects whose IRR is less than R where R is our hurdle rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hurdle rate cost of capital our discount rate。 Now I do want to mention the
    IRR rules informative it's also somewhat intuitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and appeals a lot to investors who tend to think in terms of returns but it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: got a number of shortcomings that we're going to explore in greater detail and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: '![](img/963bec46078c8b50dd4828559918c59e_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: following。 I've plotted the cost of capital on the horizontal axis and the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: project NPV on the vertical axis and what the blue line shows is it shows how
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NPV of the project varies as I vary the cost of capital。 Two points are worth，
    noting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First is this point right here which is the 12% cost of capital of the， project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll notice that generates an NPV as we saw earlier of a little bit， over
    700 million dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second point I want to point out is this point。 The， point where the graph
    crosses the x-axis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the point at which the NPV is， zero which as we know from our definition
    earlier is just the IRR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's 43。7%。 Now I think this graph is let me clear this up a little bit。 This
    graph is useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because from a sensitivity analysis or a robustness perspective。 Look this R
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an estimate and to be honest with you it's typically a noisy one。 What I see
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is I see a really wide gap between my estimated cost of capital and the point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at which this project just breaks even。 So even if we disagree on the cost of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: capital and you're taking a more conservative view and you think it's up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or you know our real cost of capital is 20% that's okay。 This project is still。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NPV positive it's still value-accretive and so what this gap here shows is it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shows that I've got a lot of room for error at least on the discount rate， dimension。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third thing we can do with our cash flows our free cash flows is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/963bec46078c8b50dd4828559918c59e_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: compute a payback period which is the duration or the time until the cumulative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: free cash flows turn positive。 So let's look at our project here are free cash，
    flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to accumulate them year over year so this 510 - 510。4 is just， the
    376。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 8 in year 0 plus the -133。16 year 1 and on and on for years 2 through 5。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I'm going to look at the cumulative free cash flows and ask when， do
    they turn positive？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well they turn positive right here in year 3 so our， payback period is year
    3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We turn cash flow positive in year 3。 Some people might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say it takes three years to recover your investment。 Is that good？ Is it bad？
    How do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we know if 3 is good？ How does that help us in our decision of whether or not
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: undertake the project？ Well what we do is we compare it to some threshold and
    so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the payback period rule is says accept all projects with a payback period less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than the threshold reject all projects with payback periods greater than that，
    threshold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it should be immediately clear that the payback rule or the payback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: period rule has several shortcomings the first of which is it's ignoring the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time value of money and risk of cash flows the first sin that we learned way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back at the start of the course。 But fortunately that's actually quite easy，
    to deal with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can compute the discounted payback period by discounting， the free cash flows
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The discounted payback period of a project is just the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: duration until the cumulative discounted free cash flows turn positive。 And
    so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this slide I computed those discounted free cash flows using our cost of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of 12% and then I accumulate them and wait or count until they turn positive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is right here in year four。 So our discounted payback period is four which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is greater than our payback period of three。 But even using the discounted payback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: period this has this rule has a number of shortcomings。 For example it ignores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cash flows after the cutoff and that's going to lead to myopic decision making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me go back a slide。 What if this cash flow in year five was 20， billion
    dollars？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well 20 billion 114 million dollars。 It'd be a shame you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to ignore that and the implication for that of that cash flow。 So by ignoring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those cash flows you get myopic decision making。 Number two it's not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: telling us the value implications of our decision。 Right it's not helping us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quantify the effects of any decision that we make。 It's also not helpful in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: choosing among projects with similar payback periods。 So I've got three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: projects they all have payback periods of four which one do I choose if I can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/963bec46078c8b50dd4828559918c59e_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: only choose one。 Alright so let's bring this all back together。 Let's bring
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/963bec46078c8b50dd4828559918c59e_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: into a full circle。 So there's several decision criteria NPV is unambiguously。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the best and should always be used。 But I want to emphasize that others such
    as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the internal rate of return and payback period or it's discounted cousin that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're all informative and the key is to understand the shortcomings of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: alternative decision criteria to avoid any mistakes that feed into the ultimate，
    decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I want to turn to in our next class is sensitivity analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which is an integral component of any DCF。 Thanks again and I look forward to，
    seeing you。
