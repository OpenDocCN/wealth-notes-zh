- en: Hello， I'm Professor Brian Boucher。 Welcome back。 In this video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to take a look at the accounts receivable and inventory， disclosures
    for the 3M Company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then， since those disclosures are not going to be that exciting， we're also
    going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to bring in a couple guest star companies。 We're going to bring in Best Buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another Minnesota Company， to take a look at their， disclosure for the Allowance
    for Bad Dats。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Honeywell， which used to be a Minnesota Company， now it's based in New Jersey，
    will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bring in their financial statements to take a look at their inventory disclosure。
    Let's get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with the balance sheet， which is on page 48 of the 3M report。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Here they report their accounts receivable， 4061 and 3867。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Those are net of allowances， and they give you the allowances right here， 105
    and 108。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the things that we calculated in the videos was what percent of the
    gross accounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: receivable does the company not expect to collect？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what's the percentage estimated on collectibles？ And has that gone up or
    down over time？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can do that for 3M。 In 2012 we would take 105 divided by not 4061， but
    4061 plus 105。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is 4166。 We want 4166 because that's the gross accounts receivable。 So
    105 divided by 4166。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could probably all deal in our head。 That's 2。5%。 We could do the same thing
    for 2011。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We would take 108 as the allowance， divided by 108 plus 3867， which is 3975。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So 108 divided by 3975 is 2。7%。 So 3M's expected on collectibles has gone down
    slightly from 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7% to 2。5%， which is not， surprising because just by looking at the numbers
    here we can see 108 was a bigger allowance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it was on a smaller net balance。 So even though the allowance has gone down
    at the same time that receivables have gone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up。 Now we're going to look for more accounts receivable information in a second，
    but since we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here， why don't we go ahead and take a look at inventories。 So on 3M's balance
    sheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they give you the breakdown into finished goods， work in process， raw materials
    and supplies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what we see is each category is growing， consistent with a growing company，
    so they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bringing in more raw materials towards the end of the year than they had at
    the beginning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the year。 They're building up their work in process over the year and they're
    building up their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finished goods inventory， presumably in anticipation of future demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we can actually see whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that's the case。 So that's what we can see about accounts receivable and inventory
    on the balance sheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， we'll make a quick stop on the cash list statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So here we have the change in accounts receivable。 So accounts receivable have
    gone up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that's a negative number on the cash list statement。 But as if you remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we look through the cash list statement， we didn't see any。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: provision for doubtful accounts or bad debt expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So 3M is using the alternative where this accounts receivable is the change
    in the net。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: number。 So instead of breaking up bad debt separately and then showing the change
    in the gross。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they just show the change in the net。 And as we've talked about before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this change of 133 is not going to match the change that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we saw on the balance sheet because some of this accounts receivable could have
    come。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in an acquisition or there could be foreign currency involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The next part of the financial statements you always want to check out is note
    one， significant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: accounting policies to see how they do the accounting for accounts receivable
    and inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we go to page 53， you'll see a note for inventories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And 3M says inventories are stated at lower cost or market， which is not a surprise
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's the rule。 You always have to carry it at lower cost or market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they say cost determined on a first in， first out basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So 3M uses FIFO for all of their inventories。 So we're not going to get any
    of those interesting LIFO disclosures in 3M。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it also， for this reason， 3M doesn't have a separate inventory footnote
    because they've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shown you the breakdown of raw material work and process， finished goods on
    the balance， sheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're using FIFO so there's no kind of LIFO related disclosures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they actually don't have a special footnote for inventories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And if we jump ahead to page 55， there's a section for accounts receivable and
    allowances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So trade accounts receivable are recorded in voiced amount， but do not bear
    interest。 That's common。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maintaining allowance for bad debts， cash discounts， product returns and other
    items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we talked about the bad debts。 We didn't talk about product returns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you allow customers to return some of their goods for a full refund， you
    have to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an allowance for that at the time of sale。 The accounting works exactly the
    same as the allowance for bad debts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where you would basically， create the contract asset account to keep track of
    expected product returns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then when their returns come in， you would get rid of the accounts or see
    when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you get rid of that allowance。 So there's really nothing new to look at there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just changing bad debts to product returns in the product stuff that we've
    done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for allows for doubtful accounts， they say it's based on their best estimate
    of probable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: credit losses。 They do it based on historical write-off experience by industry
    and regional economic data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they use historical sales returns for the product returns。 Nothing that
    new or interesting here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_17.png)'
  prefs: []

    which is part of。

    as they talk about their。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: working capital。 They say receivables increased 5% compared to the prior year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: driven by an increase in， fourth quarter sales， so its growth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They also had some acquisitions that brought in accounts receivable and some
    foreign currency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: adjustments。 Inventory increased by 12% with increases partially attributable
    to an increase in demand in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fourth quarter of 2012。 I guess they must be building more inventory in response
    to the demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There were also some acquisitions that added to the inventory and currency translation
    effects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the currency translation effects and the acquisitions are why we don't see
    the balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sheet change match the change on the cash flow statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's all I could find about bad debt and inventory in the 3M report， which
    means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there was something very interesting that they left out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: You know what it is？ What's missing is that 3M never discloses in their report
    what their bad debt expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is。 How can they get away with that？ Well there's something called the materiality
    principle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which says that if an item is so， small that its disclosure would not change
    how investors view the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you don't， need to disclose it separately。 For instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you never see paperclip expense on an income statement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Paperclip expense is just lumped in with the SGA expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can assume in a case like 3M if they're not disclosing bad debt expense，
    it's very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: small and you could treat it as effectively zero if you're doing some of the
    calculations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we've done during this week。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now let's take a look at our special guest company Best Buy for how they treat
    their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accounts receivable and bad debts。 So on their balance sheet they have a receivables
    number and notice it doesn't say anything about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: allowances here。 Now when we look at these balances which are 2704 at the end
    of the year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2288 at the， beginning of the year。 Those are still net balances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You just don't know what they're net of because there's no disclosure of the
    allowance here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_27.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If we go to Best Buy's cash flow statement， up here in the things that we add
    back we might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_29.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: see provision for doubtful accounts or bad debt expense added back， we don't
    see it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they're using the technique where they just take their change in net receivables
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_31.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: they don't break out bad debt separately。 But then what Best Buy provided was
    something called schedule 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this used to be required for all companies but now the SEC says you don't
    have to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: anymore and Best Buy still does it and this is where they put all of their information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and their allowances。 So notice they have here allowance for doubtful accounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have a beginning balance and， an ending balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is the spot where they're showing you the allowances that that balance
    sheet number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is net of。 So remember the balance sheet number at the beginning of the period
    was 2288 which means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that the balance and growth at the beginning of the period was 2288 plus 72
    equals 2360。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the period the net number of the balance sheet was 2704。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we add 92 we would get 2796 for the gross amount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things that we can now do though is we can figure out cash collection
    from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers because we have bad debt expense and more importantly the write offs
    and recoveries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is the number that we need to plug into that accounts receivable account
    to try to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get at cash collections。 So if we set up a T account what we're going to do
    is have a beginning balance of 2360。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is in accounts receivable and by the way if there's anybody taking this
    class who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: works for Adobe and you can figure out a way in the next update to avoid it
    catching。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this thing all the time so I have to escape。 Please feel free to add that update
    that would be awesome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyway so when our accounts receivable we have 2360 beginning balance 2796 as
    our ending。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: balance write offs and recoveries were 14。 We put those on the credit side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this is write offs and recoveries so it's net of that so we don't have to
    worry about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finding separate recoveries this is just the net number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what we can do then is plug in sales on the debit side of the T account
    so hang。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on I'm going to flip back to the income statement for a second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_33.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_34.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Here's revenue 4505。 So we can put 4505 here on the debit side and then the
    only thing that we're missing is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cash collection from customers so we can plug that answer as 44635。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if we hadn't been able to find these write offs recoveries we would have
    been pretty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: close we would have only been off by 14。 You can always you know even if you
    can't find that you can do it as an approximation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but this gives you a little bit more exact number on the cash collection from
    customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by best buy。 So if you don't see allowances on the balance sheet one thing to
    look for in the report。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is there may be a separate schedule which gives you all the details on both
    the balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the allowance and the bad debt expense which you can then use to do your
    calculations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_36.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: One thing I find interesting comparing best buy to what we saw with 3M is that
    if you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: calculate the percent of best buys allowance as a percent of gross accounts
    receivable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's about 3。1% in 2011 and 3。4% in 2012 which is not that much bigger than
    3M's 2。7% but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: yet 3M is saying it's immaterial and not disclosing it whereas best buy we are
    getting a disclosure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think what's going on here is best buys in the retail segment and I think
    there's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: probably more demand from investors and analysts to keep up on bad debt expense
    in the retail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: segment than there is in the manufacturing segment where 3M operates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think there's a category an example where investors must not care that
    much about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3M's bad debt expense whereas best buy it is something they want to see even
    if it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_38.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: small so they can track trends over time or compare to other retailers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's take a quick look at our other special guest company Honeywell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So on their balance sheet they disclose inventories 42。35 at the end of the
    year 42。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 64 at the beginning， of the year they don't provide the breakout of raw materials
    work in process or finish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: goods and if you ever see a manufacturing company that doesn't provide that
    breakout。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they probably have a separate footnote where they give that breakout later which
    is what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d15b67c86d99b9656256320579bd7836_40.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: we'll see with Honeywell。 There's a summary of significant accounting policies
    if we go down to inventories we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market no duh they're always
    valued。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out or average cost
    method so FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or weighted average and the LIFO method for certain qualifying domestic inventories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why does Honeywell use different methods because they're a multinational
    company and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inside the US they could use LIFO or these other methods outside the US they
    don't have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much of a choice because they can't do LIFO it's either FIFO or average cost
    and so what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Honeywell must realize is that they can get some tax savings in the US by using
    LIFO so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they use it here for certain inventories but then outside the US they have to
    use either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO or average costs。 So if we go to the next page of the excerpts there's
    a footnote for inventories and here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it is the breakdown of raw materials work and process and finished goods then
    we have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a subtotal reduction to cost basis this is the LIFO reserve and then we have
    below that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the total inventory this is what shows up on the balance sheet this is the balance
    sheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that includes LIFO。 Now notice it's not all LIFO but it includes the LIFO valuation
    of the inventories that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are on LIFO which means that this number above the reserve is what it would
    be under。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FIFO or weighted average which is what they also use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then down below they say inventory is valued at LIFO amount of 2， 325 and
    302 this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 325 is how much of that inventory is carried at LIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as you can see the vast majority of their inventory is not carried at LIFO
    it's FIFO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or weighted average but this LIFO reserve of 197 or you can get the number here
    it applies。
  prefs: []
