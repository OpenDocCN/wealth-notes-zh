- en: but before doing so， I want to briefly recap our last topic， Discounted Cash
    Flow Analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you'll recall， we started off with a discussion of how firms， or people more
    generally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should be making， decision through different decision criteria。 Then we talked
    about free cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least from a conceptual standpoint。 We then discussed forecast drivers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or the assumptions required to forecast free cash flows into the future。 If
    you'll remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we did that in the context of a tablet。 We then applied our assumptions， our
    forecast drivers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to our free cash flow formula to get forecasts of free cash flows for our tablet
    project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then brought our decision criteria back in and applied it to the forecasted
    free cash flows to come to a decision of whether or not to proceed with our tablet
    project。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We closed out the topic with a discussion of sensitivity analysis to investigate
    just how robust our assumptions and decisions are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today， I want to talk about return on investment。 In particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what I want to discuss is the strengths and weaknesses of the internal rate
    of return relative to the net present value rule。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's get started。 Hey everybody， welcome back to Corporate Finance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today we're turning to a new topic， return on investment， but before diving
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I actually want to spend a little bit of time recapping our last topic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discounted cash flow analysis。 What we did in our DCF topic is we began by introducing
    decision making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We showed some evidence， looked at some survey evidence of what people in practice
    were doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We showed CFOs of non-financial companies， private equity managers， and investment
    bankers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we showed that they used a number of different criteria， DCF， NPV， IRR，
    and payback period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we turned to looking at free cash flow， one of the key components of any
    DCF。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we talked about the components that make up free cash flow and how to aggregate
    them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we talked about forecast drivers， where the assumptions necessary to forecast
    each of the components of free cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we did it in the context of a capital budgeting example of a tablet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then applied our forecast drivers to forecast out each component of free
    cash flow and aggregate up to get a free cash flow projection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then looked at different decision criteria。 That is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we figured out what to do with those cash flows and ultimately what decision
    to make regarding the tablet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifically， we looked at NPV， IRR， and payback period。 We talked about their
    strengths。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of their weaknesses。 And then we closed out the topic with a discussion
    of sensitivity analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an integral element of any DCF。 Now， I really want to continue on the theme
    set by DCF and talk about return on an investment and really emphasize IRR versus
    NPV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the two most commonly used decision metrics。 So let's get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So recall that the internal rate of return of an asset is the one discount rate
    such that the NPV of the assets free cash flow is equal to zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I have NPV， I have cash flow， we could have free cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't let the convention change you confuse you IRR is much broader than just
    free cash flow as is cash flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But anyway， IRR is just that one discount rate such that the NPV is equal to
    zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The IRR decision rule as you might recall says accept all projects for which
    the IRR is greater than R。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reject all projects for which the IRR is less than R。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where R is our hurdle rate or opportunity cost of capital。 And the intuition
    was simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if it's costing us R% to raise money to fund investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that investment should return something at least as big， if not greater than
    R， preferably greater。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， I'm going to spend some time here talking about IRR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little bit of motivation here because rates of return are really popular measures
    used for making decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember back to the survey evidence， internal rate of return was the most popular
    decision criteria used by CFOs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it just edged out NPV。 And likewise for PE firms， private equity firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: internal rate of return is by far the dominant decision criterion used for evaluating
    investments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's really important to understand this criterion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's compare it to NPV and let's do it by way of an example， shortly， I
    should say。 So first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the IRR is going to lead to the same decision except to reject as the NPV rule
    if all negative cash flows proceed all positive cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's some examples of cash flow sequences， at least the sign of the cash
    flows where the IRR and NPV rules will coincide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I pay a bunch of money today and then I get nothing but positive cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I pay money for the first three years， let me lay it out， I don't like that，
    let's do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For year one， two and three and then years four， five and on are all positive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key is that the negatives have to come before the positives， negative before
    positive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then IRR and NPV lead to the same decision。 If that pattern of cash flow signs
    is violated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not only may IRR and NPV rules not coincide， not lead to the same decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you can get some pretty wacky stuff with IRR from multiple IRRs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in which case which one do you choose。 It's not obvious to imaginary IRRs and
    I mean mathematically imaginary IRRs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll get an IRR times some number times the square root of negative one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is really hard to convey to a CEO， trust me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's think about whether or not we can compare projects using IRR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's where I want to work in the context of a specific example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine Wharton wants to upgrade its IT system and overhaul its network infrastructure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it puts out a request for proposals in RFP and incomes a bid from Cisco。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Cisco bid we evaluate to generate $60 million in cost savings over three
    years for an upfront cost cost to Wharton of $100 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if our cost of capital， Wharton's cost of capital is 12%， what is our assessment
    of this bid？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First things first， write down the cash flows。 Here they are。 We're going to
    get， right， bid one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to cost us $100 million today， then we're going to experience cost
    savings of $60 million for the next three years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can compute， let's clear this up， we can compute the IRR by solving this
    equation， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just set the NPV for the project equal to zero and solve for IRR。 That gets
    us 36%。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because the IRR is greater than the discount rate， our hurdle rate， remember
    that was 12%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the cash flow signs are proper， that is they follow， right， negatives followed
    by positives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This project looks good。 If we compute the NPV， if we just discount the cash
    flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: future cash flows by the Wharton's cost of capital 12%， we're going to get an
    NPV of $44。11 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is greater than zero。 Well， that looks good too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So both IRR and NPV point in the same direction。 This looks like a reasonable
    bid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wharton's going to be better off by accepting it。 But then Cisco comes back
    and they say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"We''re going to give you the same cost savings， $60 million over three years。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but now what we're going to do instead of charging you $100 million up front。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to spread the costs over time。 $20 million today and then $35 million
    over three years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"， So let''s try evaluating this bid。 I mean， it sounds somewhat attractive
    if we can avoid that huge up front bill。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So， for bid 1A， here are the costs。 It's going to cost us $20 million up front
    as opposed to $100 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we're going to have to pay $35 million over the next three years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We still get the same cost savings， so the net cash flows for this bid are minus
    20， 25， 25 and 25。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's compute the IRR and NPV， IRR first。 Well， the IRR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we set the NPV of these cash flows equal to zero， solve for the IRR， and we
    get， whoa， 112%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's impressive。 That is very impressive。 And we see that the IRR for bid
    1A， this bid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is 112% is greater， much greater。 I'm going to put much greater than the first
    bid from Cisco。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which had an IRR of 36%。 We can also compute the NPV by just discounting by
    the cost of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 12% -- Wharton's cost of capital。 That gets us an NPV of $40。05 million。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bid 1 had an NPV of $44。11 million。 Bid 1A has a NPV of $40。05 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which according to the NPV rule means bid 1 is better than bid 1A。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/65a3dd1ef24fa3aed0f22b8c2dfc659b_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What's going on here？ NPV says bid 1 is better。 Right？ 44。1 is bigger than the
    40。05。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IRR says bid 1A is better because 112% returns better than 36% return。 What
    do we do？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's take a closer look。 That's the first thing we do。 And we see， let's look。
    Here's bid 1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cisco's costs are $100 million all up front。 For bid 1A -- sorry， Cisco's costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wharton's costs are $100 million up front。 Bid 1A， Wharton's costs are only
    $20 million up front。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but then $35 million every year thereafter。 And so what bid 1A is doing is it's
    inserting a loan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cisco's lending us money。 In particular， they're lending us $80 million today
    in exchange for $35 million over the next three years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's a question。 What's the interest rate on the loan？ We can figure that
    out。 Right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can figure out what the interest rate on this loan is。 How？ Just compute the
    IRR。 Right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just compute the IRR。 And if we do that， we see that the interest rate is 15%。
    Right？ And again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is just the IRR。 I want to emphasize it。 Let me clean that up。 It doesn't
    look like -- right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I move this over here， this will be zero。 This will equal -- oops。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having trouble equals minus 80。 Right？ Okay。 So that is just the IRR。 It's 15%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also the yield to maturity， which we've discussed in the past。 Well， is
    the 15% higher low？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it good or bad？ Well， it's terrible。 Cisco is charging us a higher interest
    rate than our cost of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words， we can go to the capital markets and raise the money for a loan
    at 12% as opposed to implicitly borrow from Cisco at 15。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See， what happened is the IRR increased because the initial investment fell
    more than the future cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right？ Small payoffs on a really small investment can generate very large returns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're dividing by small numbers here。 Okay。 See， but the NPV rightfully fell
    because Cisco's lending us money at an interest rate that's greater than our cost
    of capital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the IRR spiked because we have this smaller upfront investment。 That's very
    misleading。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The NPV fell。 It accurately captured the bad loan Cisco was inserting into the
    deal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the lesson here is that IRR projects can mislead when we're deciding
    among projects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whereas NPV will not mislead in comparisons。 The larger the NPV， the greater
    the value。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's briefly talk about a couple of additional bids， just to hammer home the
    point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also heard from Juniper and Huawei， who had costs and cost savings for us
    as laid out in this table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how would we rank these bids according to the IRR and NPV？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we know how to compute the IRR and NPV。 We just replicate or repeat what we
    did for Cisco or what we've done in past lectures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you get this set of IRRs and this set of NPVs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what you quickly see is that the IRR ranking is that the Huawei number three
    bid is bigger than the number two bid from Juniper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is better than the number one bid from Cisco。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The exact opposite ranking relative to what NPV tells us。 And here's a picture
    of what's going on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/65a3dd1ef24fa3aed0f22b8c2dfc659b_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I've got the discount rate。 We've seen a picture like this before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've got the discount rate on the horizontal axis and I've got NPV on the vertical
    axis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And each line graphs the relation between NPV as a function of the discount
    rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So at our cost of capital here， if we go up to each line， we can see the NPVs
    of each of the bids。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And quite clearly， the Cisco bid on the green line is better than the Juniper
    bid on the red line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is better than the Huawei bid， which is on the red line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what we've seen here is that the NPV is the NPV which is the NPV which is
    on the blue line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we go over here where the lines cross the x-axis， these are the IRRs。 By
    definition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the IRR is the discount rate where the NPV equals zero。 Here are the IRR --
    oh， sorry about that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are the IRRs。 In this case， we see that the IRR for Huawei is much bigger
    than the IRR for Juniper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is bigger than the IRR for Cisco。 So， the IRR rule， or relative to the
    NPV rule。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/65a3dd1ef24fa3aed0f22b8c2dfc659b_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What's going on？ Well， if you look more closely at the cash flow streams。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see that Huawei is small upfront costs。 That increases the IRR， relatively
    speaking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Juniper has front-loaded cash flows， which is going to increase the IRR
    relative to the Cisco bid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one lesson is the IRR does not address differences in scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's no better way to emphasize this point than to ask would you rather
    earn 100% on a $1 investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or 10% on $1 million of investment？ Well， quite clearly the latter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're going to wind up with a lot more money。 Some more intuition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Juniper's bid is actually like Cisco's with an embedded loan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see that here where Cisco charges $100 million， then you get the
    cost savings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What Huawei is doing is it's giving you an $80 million loan and then charging
    you $40 every period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as opposed to the $35 million that Cisco's 1A bid was charging you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if we ask what the loan is on this interest rate， right？ What the interest
    rate is on this loan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we see it's 23%。 The IRR to this loan is just 23%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is much bigger than the 12% cost of capital that Warden faces。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/65a3dd1ef24fa3aed0f22b8c2dfc659b_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Okay， let's summarize this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/65a3dd1ef24fa3aed0f22b8c2dfc659b_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What are the lessons here？ Look， internal rate of return is useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a way to convey the attractiveness of a project or an investment in a manner
    that investors get returns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， the problem with the IRR decision rule is that it only works or overlaps
    with NPV in certain situations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when we're not comparing projects and when the cash flow slides are all negative
    cash flows preceding all positive cash flows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think the end message here is that use IRR in your project evaluation and
    your investment analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your capital budgeting， but be cognizant of the limitation。 No when to use it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: no when not to use it。 That's what's critical。 So thank you so much for listening
    and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture in which we're going to talk
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are we going to talk about？ Oh， the cost of capital。 Bye bye。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
