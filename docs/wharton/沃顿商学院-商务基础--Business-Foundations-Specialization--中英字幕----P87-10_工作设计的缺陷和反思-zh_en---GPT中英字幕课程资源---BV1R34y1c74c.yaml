  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well， the drawback to Taylor's approach and this engineering approach to designing
    jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that people hated doing these kinds of jobs。 And one of the reasons they
    hated them was because they were so boring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the very beginnings many people believe of management research happened at
    Western， Electric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the company that made telephones and telephone equipment， where they had people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there working on tasks that were designed more or less with scientific management
    approaches。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and their paid piece rates， so much for each task they performed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they discovered that people weren't working very hard here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a bunch of engineers and researchers came in to study them and try to figure
    out what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was going on。 And there's a lot of debate as to what they really found。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the general conclusion was， that the workers there cared about things other
    than just the piece rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the key things they cared about was their social interactions with
    each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Part of what they were doing was systematically holding down effort， even though
    it was costing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them individually money。 And I think part of the reason was the belief that
    if they worked harder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then the bosses， would just cut the piece rates。 And so they wouldn't end up
    making any more money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This goes back to our earlier discussion about motivation and particularly the
    idea of expectancy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you believe that the employer will actually do what they say？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here they believe they would not。 So if we worked harder and started producing
    more and making more money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the company would， just cut the rates so that we don't make more money and then
    we'd be stuck having to work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: faster and harder。 Now the biggest problem with this scientific management approach
    though comes a generation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: later in the 1970s and particularly in these assembly operations， the most important
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which were in the auto industry。 And it arises from the fact that people hated
    their jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the poster child for this problem， although it was happening around the
    world， not just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the US， was General Motors plant in the city of Lordstown， Ohio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A plant that made Chevrolet Vegas， an early car that was designed to compete
    with the Japanese。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fuel efficient car。 I owned one really lousy car to be honest and really not
    very safe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The car had enormous quality problems。 So in a typical car plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have what's known as a rework area。 Car comes off the assembly line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They turn the key to start it。 If it doesn't start。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it goes over to a rework area where some multi-skilled people will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: plunge in on it and see if they can fix what's wrong。 The Vega plant didn't
    have a rework area。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It had a rework parking lot because so many cars would come off the assembly
    line and not， work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when they opened the hood to try to look inside the car and see what was
    wrong， they'd。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see bunch of stuff missing， like no carburetor， or they would see things that
    look like sabotage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: washers thrown in the throat of the carburetor， upholstery slashed， things like
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A thousand or so cars at a time that really weren't working。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they tried to figure out what was going on here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they looked into the factory and it didn't look that much different than
    other factories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: except it was even more automated。 The assembly line moved even faster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which meant that people had to do those repetitive， tasks more of them over
    the course of the day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big thing was the workforce was pretty young and was actually had some college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the average worker had been to school at least a year or so of college。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Problem was the work was really boring。 Another time as they perfected scientific
    management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the work got even more boring and， you had a generation of people going into
    these jobs who were going to do this for the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rest of their life。 And unlike their parents who had come out of the Great Depression。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this didn't seem like， such a great deal to them。 Now the reason this mattered
    is because the quality problems were really bad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially， for cars compared to the Japanese system， which was much better
    built cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And quality translates into money。 So quality problems were causing performance
    problems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which were causing financial problems。 And we're ultimately going to cause the
    entire US auto industry a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: market share， business， jobs， everything。 So we had to do something about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what did we do？ So what happened during the 1970s， at least toward the
    end of the 1970s。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was an effort， to rethink job design， to look at how we were organizing work
    and the performance of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tasks at the level of the worker in these big assembly plants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason we're doing this is because it was costing the companies a lot of
    money and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the workers were miserable too。 A lot of strikes over little things， turnover
    problems， et cetera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the new approach was to think about these jobs from， you might say， a
    human perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rather than an engineer's perspective。 So the engineer's perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're thinking about fitting people to the machines。 And the more human perspective
    was saying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: okay， what are the people like and how might， you adapt the work to accommodate
    the needs and the interests of the people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least， a bit。 So what is it we learned about people and what they liked about
    their work and what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they hated about their work？ Well in general， one of the things that people
    like about work is social interactions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're with other people。 And often we like the people we work with。 And if
    we do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's a big reason for going to work and one of the things we liked about，
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things we learned from those Western Electric studies was that， that
    the people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in these assembly operations in Western Electric wanted to talk to each other
    and paid a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of attention to what everybody else was doing。 The other thing we learned about
    jobs and what people liked about them was a series of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things about the tasks and how they were performed beyond simply getting a paycheck
    at the end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's kind of a list of these upon which there's general agreement now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the first of these might be the idea of autonomy which you can think about
    as control。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do I control about my work？ Do I get to decide for example when I get to
    take a break？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do I get to decide how I perform this particular task？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well under the scientific management approach of Frederick Taylor， the answer
    to every one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of those questions is going to be no。 You don't control anything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The engineers that designed your job specified everything about it and we figured
    out on average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the best way to do everything so we don't need any of your help。 Thank you very
    much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well it turns out that even if what they're doing is not optimal from a design
    point of， view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: individuals really like to have control。 The more control they've got， the happier
    they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more control they've got， the， less stress they feel about things。 So autonomy
    is one big thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A second thing that they really value is variety。 People get bored doing the
    same thing over and over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a phrase for this in psychology called habituation which means that
    we turn off stimulus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is repetitive and doesn't seem to matter very much to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably know this if you've ever moved into a new place and particularly
    if it's maybe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: someplace where there's a lot of noise around。 You woken up early in the morning
    because the garbage trucks come in or there's a big。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pot hole in front of your house and you can't sleep the first few nights。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then after that you find that you can sleep and then you're okay with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your brain is just tuned it out and you don't even notice it anymore until you
    get a visitor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who stays with you and then they're up all night and they say I couldn't sleep。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That stupid pot hole in front of your house and you're saying what are you talking
    about？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your brain has tuned it out and the problem with repetitive work always the
    same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over and over and over is that our brain begins to tune the workout and we're
    just not paying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attention to it anymore。 And for workers this is pretty dangerous especially
    if you're working with machinery that is heavy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and powerful and you could rip yourself off pretty good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're worried just about the quality of the work you're doing it's not good
    for that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: either because you're not paying attention to things and it's easy to start
    making mistakes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or ignore quality problems as they're coming along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So from the human perspective variety matters a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third thing that seems to matter a lot is do we understand and appreciate
    how what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're doing fits into the bigger picture of what maybe the company is doing
    or the agency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're working for。 What is the significance of my work？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the field of healthcare for example some famous studies looking at hospital
    induced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: infections， real problem in terms of hospital stays you get sick in the hospital
    and you're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: already not in great shape which is why you're there in the first place and
    then you pick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up an infection which has been bred and perfected in the hospital and it's really
    hard to get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rid of and you know a lot of people have great complications including death
    from these hospital。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: induced infections。 Well what's the cause of these bacteria and viruses in the
    environment of the hospital？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What could you do to control this？ Clean the place up right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kill germs on the walls on the floors on the equipment everything around。 Who's
    in charge of that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well if there's one group it's probably the janitorial staff which is the group
    of employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are often ignored lowest of the pecking order in the organizational chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well in these studies what they did is they explained to the janitors the significance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of their work。 Here's hospital induced infections， here's what they look like
    when people get sick。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're， killing a lot of people it's a terrible thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cause is bacteria on the walls and equipment if we wipe that out and here's
    how we wipe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it out then these guys don't get sick。 And once they were able to not just explain
    but show the janitors what this meant then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the janitors were much more effective at cleaning the rooms， hospital induced
    infection rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fell and the reason for this is the janitors cared more about their work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They were more motivated you might say but it was really something about their
    appreciation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for what they were doing that caused them to do the jobs better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing which is actually related to the significance question is can
    I get feedback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the tasks I perform can I see how it's going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And back to the janitors for a minute when they could get information on how
    well they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: had cleaned rooms that come in maybe and do swabs and check for bacteria accounts
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they could tell when they did a good job and when they did a poor job they were
    paying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more attention to the work it made the work more interesting for people turn
    over rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fell employee satisfaction improved commitment to the organization that is caring
    about doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a good job went up as well and these are four of the big factors and they all
    relate to how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the job is performed。 None of this has anything to do with money nor does it
    have anything to do with benefits。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or anything like that。 It's all about how the tasks themselves are performed。
