  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the way this works is a health inspector visits a restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    places a sign in the window that says that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is an A hygiene grade。 B is a lower grade and C of course is a lower grade
    down still。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the co-authors Jin and Leslie wanted to figure out whether or not providing
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information into the market would change the behavior of the consumers that
    were there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_30.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And what did they find？ Well what they found was the demand at restaurants that
    got an A went up quite substantially about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5 to 6 percent。 And at restaurants that got a B actually went up hardly perceptibly
    less than 1 percent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_32.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and demand at restaurants that got a C of course went down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So once the information was in the market people as you might imagine wanted
    to go to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: restaurants that had better hygiene and better quality food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that was a buyer explanation or that was an effect on demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there's also an effect of information on supply which I think is at least
    as interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps even more so。 So what did the provision of that information in the market
    due to the salads？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well it caused them actually to increase the quality of what they were offering
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_34.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: now there's more of a benefit to be known as an A restaurant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So to check this out what the researchers did was something very clever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They looked at the number of people that got sent to hospital for food related
    illnesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what they found was in markets where the signs were in place that went down
    substantially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about 13 percent whereas in other parts of California that didn't have the system
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: number of people going to hospital for food borne illness was actually going
    up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_36.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So again that's a pretty clever test that shows this was also affecting the
    behavior of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the salads as well as the behavior of the buyers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_38.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So what do we learn from this？ Here's the key principle is that reviews and
    review systems definitely change behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both of buyers and also of salads。 But the most important thing knowing that
    is that reviews ideally should be objective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and verifiable but this is not always the case。 So let's look at a couple of
    research examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_40.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The first one was a very clever study that was done by two professors at Yale
    that examined。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether or not reviews for books help ramp up sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_42.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And they looked at two different websites Amazon。com and Barnes and Noble。com
    and what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they found is most of the people who write reviews are in fact fairly generous。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are five possible stars that you could give for a book at Amazon and the
    average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rating at the time of the study was about 4。1。 On Barnes and Noble for whatever
    reason people are even more generous the average rating was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about 4。5。 One star reviews are pretty rare that's the lowest review。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one star reviews would show up about 7 percent of the time on Amazon and
    about 3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: percent of the time on Barnes and Noble。 So did all of this reviewing have any
    impact on sales？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah you better did。 So what the authors found is if you got more positive reviews
    sales of your book went up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they also found if you got more negative reviews one star reviews then sales
    of your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: book went down。 And in addition there was kind of a subtle effect of this negative
    information such that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I got a negative review on a book that I'd written a one star review that
    seemed in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some sense to also slow down the rate of positive reviews that were coming along
    subsequently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_44.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So again a very very interesting study showing that reviews are affecting sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now of course this might motivate people who are selling books to review their
    own books。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_46.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: if they know that it's going to have a positive effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I'm showing here and you can read the articles and the links is a picture
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a very interesting lady Harriet who has reviewed over 25，000 books on Amazon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm not suggesting that she hasn't but it's just interesting to notice that
    one person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can generate so many reviews。 Now in addition to our friend Harriet there was
    another fellow who was doing something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps a little more devious but in some ways quite clever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a fellow called Mr Rutherford you can read the article I've provided
    a link， for it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What he decided to do was to offer himself as a review writing service for authors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you just written a book he might be willing to write 20 reviews for you
    for some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of money let's say $100 or $500 completely of course fake reviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_48.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And what was interesting about this is Mr Rutherford was making about $28，000
    not a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but a month by doing these fake reviews。 So what does this tell us？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It tells us that information is powerful and it also tells us that sellers might
    want to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: manipulate the information that's offered。 So you might be sitting there scratching
    your head as I was when I first read that story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Somebody making almost $30，000 a month providing fake reviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So clearly this is a bit of a problem and it's come to the attention of many
    other writers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and kind of experts and so how might one address this problem of fake information
    being out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a76e80d815d3264beaeb92c2f63e7c_50.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well on the next slide I'm showing a story you can read the full story in the
    New York。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Times about a gentleman who's an expert in something called data mining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what he would do is he would go through all of the text of reviews and try
    and figure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out what reviews are real and what reviews are fake and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now even though that's a pretty sophisticated technique it turns out that it's
    actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: difficult for a computer to figure out what's really true and what's not under
    certain kinds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of circumstances。 So it would be difficult for example for a data mining algorithm
    to figure out if I was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    be quite difficult。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So to look at this question from a different perspective， Deena Maislin who's
    a professor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now at USC she was one of the original authors on the other study I mentioned
    about looking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the effect of reviews on Barnes and Noble and Amazon decided to tackle this
    problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a very very interesting way。 So let me illustrate that for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What she did is she wanted to compare ratings on TripAdvisor versus ratings
    on Expedia for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the same property。 Well let's choose a property so we can all be clear about
    what we're talking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it turns out there's a share of no-tell on the corner of 36th and Chestnut
    Street here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in Philadelphia。 So Deena and her co-authors were curious as to whether the
    reviews of that property were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the same on TripAdvisor as they were on Expedia。 So most of you have probably
    been to those websites and you'll notice again it's a 5-star。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: review system and you get a histogram of reviews。 So some number of 1-star reviews，
    2-star reviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3-star reviews， 4-star reviews and 5-star reviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if both of those sites are providing the same objective information those
    histograms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should be identically matched。 So that was the test that she wanted to see were
    the histograms different for the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: property。 And what she found was on TripAdvisor there were slightly more 1-star
    reviews for certain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: properties and also slightly more 5-star reviews。 And when she dug in a little
    bit more what she found was if you were operating that hotel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Sheridan Hotel at 36th and Chestnut Street and located quite close to you
    was a competitor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a competitor who perhaps just owned their own little hotel。 Let's call it Chris'
    Hotel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chris our friendly videographer and Chris' hotel is competing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the Sheridan and because he's a one-man shop not really accountable to
    a big organisation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as I would be if I were a manager at the Sheridan he would be more likely to
    write a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one-star review and try and knock his competitor， the Sheridan at 36th and he
    would be more likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to write a 5-star review and to praise his own property。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: That's what Dina and her colleagues found。 So again it's very very interesting
    to think about whether review information is valid。
  prefs: []
