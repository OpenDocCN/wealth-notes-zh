    the alarm of any。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: evil design。 They are enabled to fathom it with common counsel and to oppose
    it with united strength。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas， when they lie dispersed without concert， order or discipline， communication
    is uncertain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: counsel difficult and resistance impractable。 So clearly there are benefits
    and this is a pretty high minded intellectual description。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we want to understand how fundamental human behavior is， we look for it
    in the primates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We look for it in lower forms basically。 We found by studying behavior in primates
    all kinds of psychological behavior that because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we see it there， we know that it is more fundamental to us。 We are hardwired
    to do these things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such it is with coalitions。 So here is a quote from Franz Duwale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the best known primeontologists out there， has a great book called Chimpanzee
    Politics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    partners。

- en: basic relationships are completely overshadowed。 This is especially dramatic
    given how hierarchical the chimps societies are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's an influence that coalitions influence their behavior even there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It shows from Edmund Burke down to the chimps how important and fundamental
    coalitions are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to human behavior。 To dig into the kinds of coalitions and the ins and outs
    of coalitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's start with， an example。 This example is from a negotiation exercise called
    Three Way Organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long-standing， exercise out of the Harvard Negotiation School。 We still use
    it every year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this negotiation， there are three parties， Neptune， Pluto， and Venus， and
    they are trying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to decide how to divide up a pot， pot of money， pot of points， whatever you
    want to， call it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they work together as a three-team organization， they have 24 points to divide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They could also just decide to work in twos， in which case there are different
    payoffs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neptune and Pluto work together。 They have 22 to divide amongst themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pluto and Venus work together。 They have 12， and then Venus and Neptune work
    together。 They have 18。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've laid the payouts out for you here on this little chart， so you'll see。
    From these payouts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it looks like Neptune has more power in this negotiation。 They're the bigger
    party。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to ask what you would do in this exercise。 We're not going to do this
    exercise today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it motivates some of what we're going to， talk about。 If you were one of
    the smaller parties。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pluto or Venus， let's put you in the smallest position。 Let's put you in the
    Venus position。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How would you go about this？ You would know that it's a coalition exercise。
    Going in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might think， "Do I form a coalition with Neptune， or should I form a coalition，
    with Pluto？"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Should I try to form a coalition with Pluto？ How do you think you would go about
    that decision？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How would you even think about that decision？ You can go through the math and
    the points and think about it that way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you might， also think about the individuals。 Who is in the role of Neptune？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What relationship do I have with them？ What kind of trust do I have with them？
    The same with Pluto。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take all this information in and then you would make a decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Am I going to place my chips with the big guy， Neptune， or the smaller guy，
    kind of medium。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: science person， Pluto， as I go in and try to form a coalition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That decision captures the two main kinds of coalitions that we see in the world，
    one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being the balance of power。 This is the longstanding dynamic we see in political
    science where the presence of a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: single dominant power leads smaller powers to band together。 In our example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we just came from Pluto and Venus want to work together to counterbalance， the
    bigger Neptune。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there is another kind。 Bandwagening is the other kind of coalition where
    the smaller powers buy with each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in order to ally with the single dominant powers。 This is a Venus saying， "Hey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why might I want to go to little Pluto when I can go to， big Neptune， more likely
    to win that way？"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are the two kinds that we see and this is often the decision that you
    face when you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are a smaller party trying to decide what kind of coalition to form。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you know which way to go？ If you're going to form a coalition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do you go with balance of power or do you go with， bandwagening？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes you're just observing this happen with other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do you predict what's going to happen？ Is it going to be a balance of
    power or coalition or is it going to be a bandwagening coalition？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we can understand that， we'll better understand coalitions。 So broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are two bases for coalition。 One is interest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think of this as kind of the economics of an arrangement。 Another is identity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think of this as kind of the emotions of the arrangement or the coalition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's dive into both the interest-based coalitions and the identity/emotions-based，
    coalitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So an example of interest-based comes with the very colorful name Baptist and
    Bootleggers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This goes back to 1980s research on U。S。 legislation and the particular example
    they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking about are in the U。S。 They're called blue laws where the distribution
    of alcohol is restricted on certain days of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the week。 So in some states or some cities， you can't sell beer and wine on
    a Sunday。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So where does this come from？ Why do these laws， some of these laws still exist
    by the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the analysis says that basically there are quote， "babdas" are not necessarily
    actual， bad best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they are religious leaders。 And what they bring to the coalition is the
    moral high ground。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the explanation of the cause。 But they're also the bootleggers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these are the people with the financial interest in making this happen。
    So with these blue laws。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are the bar owners。 They would love for there to be no other place to get
    alcohol except bars on Sundays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so their interest is financial。 And to make that happen， they can provide
    campaign funds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you have this very powerful coalition。 You wouldn't necessarily expect together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't seem like the kinds of people that would work together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But because they have common economic interests， they form a strong coalition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course it's effective because from the legislators' perspective， you
    have the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: moral high ground saying you're doing it for religious reasons， but you also
    get campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: funds because the bootleggers can provide that as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Bruce Yandall who created this theory back in the early '80s says durable
    social。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: regulation occurs when it's demanded by both of two distinctly different groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it takes that complementarity but with a common economic interest to form
    a very strong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coalition。 So more recently， we've seen examples such as green energy where
    big financial interests。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have come into back green energy， especially in say California。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it looks like it's for environmental reasons。 But in fact， if you look at
    the reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's regulatory advantages and actually they're， in there for investment。
    That's what they do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of course。 But because they've got kind of the moral high ground and the financial
    interest， it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a complementary and strong economic based coalition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a very rational calculus available when you're making these decisions
    based on， interest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's the expected value of allying with A， party A， for example， versus the
    expected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: value of allying with party B？ So just go through the math。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's the probability that A wins times the payoff to me if A wins versus the
    probability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that B wins times the payoff to me if B wins。 So this sounds very rational and
    very narrow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's the claim here that many coalitions get done on exactly those grounds。
    In short。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which party is likely to win and how will I be treated as a partner to that。
  prefs: []

- en: party if they do。 So one of the challenges with these kinds of coalitions is
    that they're dynamic in that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people are kind of always hopping around trying to find a better deal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a great quote from Speaker Boehner， a longtime speaker in the US House
    who said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"I like to describe my job as trying to get 218 frogs in a wheelbarrow long
    enough to， pass a bill。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's hard to do。 218 being the one vote majority to pass legislation in the
    House。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e9535265462e5f1268b9af0b613c2d2f_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The reason it's hard is because he might get everyone lined up for a moment
    and then somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: else is going to start trying to poach them。 And because they're doing this
    calculus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might be able to raise the anti just enough， that they'll jump out of the
    wheelbarrow and form a coalition with somebody else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"， My favorite example， one of the most powerful examples， comes from a study
    of alliance formation。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in civil wars。 So this was done in recent years looking at civil wars， multi-party
    civil wars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's room for coalitions over an almost 200-year period of time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the cover here is from Afghanistan， but in fact， they looked at civil wars
    in 53 different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: areas。 And this is Fotini-Christia。 She writes， "History's replete with warring
    leaders changing sides。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is surprising to us because we tend to think， especially from the cover
    here， that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these would be religious-based conflicts， very moral， tribal-based conflicts。
    But in fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they observe that warring groups will aim to side with the winner so long as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can have a credible guarantee that the winner will not strip them of power
    once victory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This is great research。 This is not intuitive。 This is not what we would have
    expected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But they find that interest， this rational calculus， drives behavior so much
    that it can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: overcome these very seemingly deeply held identity issues。 I've talked with
    special forces students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: students who previously were in the special forces。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who talk about being in the field and seeing men actually change sides during
    battle as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the calculus changes during battle and one side looks more likely to win。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the other form of coalitions， the other basis on which coalitions get formed
    are identity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More emotion-based， could be loyalty。 And it leads one to sacrifice narrow economic
    interest in service for these other objectives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example also from the military world comes from the UK and France alliance
    in World， War I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they did not have a formal treaty when World War I started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They had some previous relationship but they didn't have a formal treaty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when Germany invaded Belgium and then France， the UK had to decide whether
    to come。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into the war on the side of France。 This is a memo from inside the Foreign Secretary
    Office in Great Britain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they write， "The argument that there is no written bond binding us to France
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: strictly correct。 There is no contractual obligation。 But the Entente has been
    made， strengthened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: put to the test and celebrated in a manner， justifying the belief that a moral
    bond was being forged。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The whole policy of the Entente can have no meaning if it does not signify that
    in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just quarrel England would stand by her friends。 This honorable expectation
    has been raised。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We cannot repudiate it without exposing our good name to grave criticism。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you see this is such a different basis for the coalition than the calculus
    we talked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about before。 In the morality， this is honor。 And indeed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Great Britain did join on the side of France。 We don't know what influenced
    this memo head but we know that there were people making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exactly this kind of argument。 Here's the same story in kind of visual terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Emotions can play a big role， drive the abused parties， the smaller parties
    together to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: team up an exact revenge。 So broadly we have this interest versus identity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interself interest or economics means the coalition candidate pool is broad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can bring anybody in as long as you can show that their economic interest
    are well， served。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it means that your ties to anybody you do bring in are relatively weak，
    relatively， shallow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively， you can appeal to identity or emotion which provides a much stronger
    connection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/e9535265462e5f1268b9af0b613c2d2f_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: but it greatly restricts the number of people you can ally with。 These are the
    trade-offs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no right answer。 There's no better way to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's two different ways we see coalitions formed。 Both matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the bottom lines is that it's risky to neglect either one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're both opportunities for you to form a coalition and they're also risks
    to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from others trying to post your coalitional partners。 Thank you。 Thank you。
