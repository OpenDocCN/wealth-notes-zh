  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one-fifth of them are influencing you and the other 80% or so are not really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: having much sway over your behavior at all。 Now if we turn the problem around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this statistic to me is also very very interesting。 They found that about one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: third of the people in the social networking site were not influenced by， anyone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are kind of the maverick people who just do their own thing and。
  prefs: []

    friends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about 30% of you out there are not influenced by anybody。 Now let's sort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of dig under the hood a little bit and try to understand the extent of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: let me now explain the blue histogram that you see in front of you。 This is
    just a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: histogram taken from the original article。 What it's showing is the amount of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influence that framed F has on user U。 And what you can see towards the left。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hand side of the chart is there are many people whose influence factor if you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like is very very small close to zero。 And in the right hand side it's a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit like a long tail diagram again。 In the right hand side at the extreme level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are some people a smaller number who are hugely influential。 And on average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about 20% of the social network people in the social networking space are， influencing
    other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what you can see on the screen now is another chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the paper and I'm just going to explain the key results here。 I think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these results actually are very interesting。 Actually fascinating results。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and things I think that we could not only use but maybe also relate a little
    bit， to our intuition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first thing the authors found was someone who's been in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: social networking site for a longer period of time on average is more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influential than somebody who's just joined。 I think that makes sense。 That's
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: nice statistically significant effect。 The second effect which I think speaks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to cultural background as well as ethnicity is that people who are from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the same ethnic or cultural background on average have more influence over。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: each other than just random people。 This is again partly due I think to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/487e3a3d3f4c9954380745e9e7c9643b_29.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: homophily。 So I'm more likely to be influenced by somebody who's from the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Australia New Zealand kind of part of the world than somebody who's just coming
    at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/487e3a3d3f4c9954380745e9e7c9643b_31.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: random。 The next thing that they looked at was gender， influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this one I find particularly fascinating。 So of course there are two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: genders and four possibilities for influence。 Men could influence woman， men
    could influence men。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: woman could influence woman， or woman could influence men。 Out of those four
    possible combinations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there was only one statistically significant path of influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The guys and the girls out there can probably relate to this。 Girls were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: influential over guys but not the converse。 And again think about what the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/487e3a3d3f4c9954380745e9e7c9643b_33.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: definition of influence is in this case。 The definition is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when somebody is engaging in activity in the social networking site posting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: commenting and so on other people are checking that out and following along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when females do that males follow along but not the converse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/487e3a3d3f4c9954380745e9e7c9643b_35.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So there's actually a lot of interesting research that's being done in the area。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of gender segmentation on the internet and I think this is just another finding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that plays right into that。 The final result that they found。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to do not with who you are as a person or how long you've been on the side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what it is that you talk about and what you say when you get there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how you present yourself。 So we've already discussed reputation and review。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a little bit of your personal reputation。 It turns out if you're on
    a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: social networking site and you're indicating that you're looking to date。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other people that significantly reduces your influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/487e3a3d3f4c9954380745e9e7c9643b_37.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So maybe think about that before you start posting too much。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay what are the implications of this if we want to advertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on social networks or we want to run social networks and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/487e3a3d3f4c9954380745e9e7c9643b_39.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There's really three things there that I put on the slide but let me just go，
    through them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all simple counts of who is， a friend with whom are not really sufficient
    to understand influence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because sometimes a friend can mean a really really close friend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other times it's a person you've just met。 There's really too much variation。
    So we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: need different ways to measure who's influential， on a social networking site。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly the authors found when they did some， simulations if you take the very
    best people out of a social networking site。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that dramatically reduces the value。 So just like in the real world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are some special people who have disproportionate influence， over others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's very very important to keep in mind。 And then the final point that's
    related to the one that I just made。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is if you want to advertise on a social networking site or you want to use a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: social networking site to promote the products and services that you may be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wanting to offer to people most of the payoff you get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is from identifying the very best and most influential people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since many many people are uninfluential at all there's great returns to figuring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out those who are the best in this environment。
