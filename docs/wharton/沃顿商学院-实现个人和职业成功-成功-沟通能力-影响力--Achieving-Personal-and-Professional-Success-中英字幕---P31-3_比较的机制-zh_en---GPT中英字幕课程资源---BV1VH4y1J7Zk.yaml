- en: And our breakdown， the mechanics of the comparisons that we make， and argue
    that they're very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fundamental force in our lives。 They help us understand some interesting puzzles。
    Here's one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why are twins separated at birth often so similar？ Nick， Tom Peterson， and Steve
    Tazumi。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they were twins separated at birth。 The two grew up in completely different
    households。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different religions， different schooling， and， yet when they got together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they were shocked at how similar they were。 One owned a bodybuilding gym and
    was a complete fitness addict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other owned a bodybuilding gym and was totally into fitness。 And when they
    got together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they said， "Oh， we connected from the first time we met because， we're so much
    alike。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to think about that question。 That is， why might twins separated at birth
    end up being so similar？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's a second puzzle。 Why do expectant fathers gain weight when there's no
    biological reason for them to gain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: weight？ By understanding the comparison process， we could gain insight into
    these puzzles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now here's the first key idea。 The comparisons we make help us make sense of
    our world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They help us understand if we went on a good vacation， if we're making a good
    salary， if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I need to redo my kitchen， if I need to buy a new car， it's comparisons that
    help us make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning out of all of these different outcomes we have in our lives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now here's some other key ideas about comparisons。 First， they're inevitable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of us make comparisons。 Now some of us are drawn to check Facebook more
    often than others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but all of us are， drawn to make these comparisons and they help us make sense
    of things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they also， drive us to feel better or motivate us or to feel worse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now part of how they work are we make comparisons that are sometimes going up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who have done better than we have。 People who have nicer apartments，
    nicer cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or comparisons where we look down。 People who might not have accomplished as
    much as us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Upward comparisons can inspire us。 They can also make us miserable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Downward comparisons can make us feel content and satisfied by our less motivating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another key idea about comparisons is that we can make them within ourselves
    and with， other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So often the comparisons we make are to somebody else。 So it could be our neighbor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it could be our brother-in-law， it could be the person that， cubicle next to
    me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we can also make internal comparisons where I think about how I did before
    or the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comparison of what I could have done。 So these internal comparisons relative
    to me or comparisons relative to others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When are comparisons most intense？ It turns out there are three dimensions that
    make comparisons more or less impactful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first dimension is similarity。 By similarity we're thinking about things
    like siblings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the closest sibling is a twin where we have very intense similarity。 So
    the more similar we are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more these comparisons matter。 And it's not just siblings。 It could be very
    close friends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People that we find ourselves similar to in the same cohort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might have started in the same class together。 Similarity is really important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in fact this similarity helps us understand things like the spread of obesity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one reason why expectant fathers gain weight， even though there's no biological
    reason for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them to do so， is they're comparing themselves to people right next to them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the husbands and wives are comparing themselves and that comparison impacts
    motivation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can see from these graphs here， first there's some kinds of comparisons that
    matter most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those are comparisons where it's actually both of us see ourselves as friends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So those are going to be the strongest friendships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're comparing ourselves to the same sex others。 So the more similar the
    person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more impactful that comparison is。 And in fact we see this network that
    helps explain the spread of obesity through friendships。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through the network， the comparisons that we're making。 We find ourselves motivated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when I see everybody else around me reaching for a donut， I figure well，
    I don't think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I should eat more donuts， but if everybody else is doing it or if that sort
    of looks fine， to me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everybody else in my comparison set is influencing my own assessment of what
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or isn't acceptable。 Now for some reason reunions can be quite stressful because
    at reunions we're going back and we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: engaging in intense comparisons。 So it could be a high school reunion， it could
    be a family reunion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There we're going to see people with whom we're likely to make comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are people from our same cohort or the same family structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They started perhaps in similar circumstances and now we're going to make these
    comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because of similarity。 The second dimension is proximity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you think about some of the most intense rivalries like the Tar Heels and
    Blue Devils。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/48a554042f1619e999f3449c82e8b05a_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: UNC and Duke。 After we're looking at rivalries， these are two schools separated
    by just nine miles with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very strong basketball teams and that intense rivalries in part fueled by proximity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now proximity is also not just between universities， but it's things like neighbors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/48a554042f1619e999f3449c82e8b05a_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So here in this quote from Borat， we see this intense neighbor comparison where
    we're thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about going back and forth who has what in their homes until he says， "Oh， great
    success。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when he finally gets something that his neighbor can't have。"， So here we have
    the first two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: similarity and proximity。 The third thing that makes comparisons particularly
    intense is self-relivance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By self-relivance， I mean something that we care about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I really care about advancing my career， who gets that promotion is self-relevant？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my neighbor wins a baking competition and I don't consider myself much of
    a baker that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lacks self-relivance。 And as a result， that comparison isn't very intense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the most intense comparisons are people who are similar like brothers， cubical
    makes， neighbors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my brother-in-law， proximity， people who are very close to me physically， and
    then， self-relivance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a domain that I really care about。 So if I'm a musician。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I care about winning that musical competition， but if I'm not， then， I care
    less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Social comparisons have these characteristics and they influence a few different
    behaviors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've already alluded to some of those so far。 The first is how we collaborate
    with other people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as we learn information， it can change the way we collaborate or compete
    with others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might find that somebody else is making more money than we are that might
    make collaboration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: harder， or we might find that somebody else has a very different background
    than we do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that might make collaboration easier and mitigate the intense comparisons
    we might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: otherwise have made。 So comparisons can make us collaborate or compete。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they can also lead us to retreat altogether。 So sometimes comparisons can
    be so unpleasant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to exit the situation because we find it so invidious。
  prefs: []
