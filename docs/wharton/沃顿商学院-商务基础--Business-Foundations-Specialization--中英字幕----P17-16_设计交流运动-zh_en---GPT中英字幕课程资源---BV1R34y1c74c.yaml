- en: campaign。 Professor Babrakhan in her earlier module spoke to you about what
    are the various components。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a go-to-market plan。 She talked about five C's and four P's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the P's of course was product design。 The next one was pricing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third one she discussed which again we went into greater detail was about
    distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The one that we are going to focus on today is promotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what does promotions include in terms of decision making？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One part of promotions is communication strategy。 In communication strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we either use mass or targeted media that could be TV， digital， print。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: outdoors and that includes advertising。 It could also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: communications could also include things like product placement and also public，
    relations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we also have within the field of promotions what we call as personal
    and interpersonal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: means of communication。 That's through sales force or word of mouth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Word of mouth can be from consumer to consumer。 It can be offline or online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also communicate with the consumer at the point of purchase oftentimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can install promotions online when somebody comes to our website， they see
    a sticker which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: says this is on sale。 The other way to promote one's products or services is
    through non-communications means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is either through price discounts or coupons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this module we are primarily going to focus on communication strategy and
    that's through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mass and targeted media。 But I think it's worthwhile for a moment to just talk
    about a few of the things that we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are not going to go into detail that are also useful。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do we mean by product placement？ Oftentimes when I ask this question people
    say it's where you place the product in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: store。 That's not what product placement is。 Product placement is placing your
    product or service in a television series or a movie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like the BMW car in a James Bond movie。 That's what we call product placement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now why companies use product placement？ Because there is a belief that anything
    that looks like advertising is actually less effective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than something that is somewhat indirect。 So seeing a BMW car in a James Bond
    movie doesn't seem like usual advertising and there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a belief amongst advertisers and communications people that anything that's
    not in your face。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is actually more effective。 Let's talk a little bit about public relations also。
    Public relations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think we all know what the word means。 Oftentimes people say public relations
    is something that's free。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Public relations is not really free。 What is really free in the public relations
    part is that you don't pay for the media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which means you don't pay for time and space。 But creating an activity that
    deserves public relations and media mentions is reasonably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expensive。 So this is an area that can be managed quite well。 It's very effective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it is not an area where you actually pay for either time or space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personal and personal communication is a very powerful means of promoting your
    products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and services。 This can be done through sales force。 It can also be done through
    word of mouth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one customer talking to another and this can， be managed quite well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pharmaceutical companies have managed this for years even before online came
    into existence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And even today with online， when you actually measure the word of mouth， 80%
    of word of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mouth is actually offline person to person and only 20% is today online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's now reflect back on our communications campaign design， which is either
    through Mars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or targeted media。 So in this module， we'll focus on a few things a little bit
    more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is what role does communications play in our marketing strategy。 In other
    words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for most of you， you might use an advertising agency or a communications， agency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you get the best out of them？ We'll spend some time on how do you actually
    design a message。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Media planning and budgeting also deserve attention， but in this session， we
    will not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talk too much about that。 We'll spend quite a bit of time on measuring the effects
    of your communications campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then summarize with some key lessons。 Let's start with an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of you may have seen the milk campaign that was a very popular campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was done by the California Milk Board in 1992。 So what did they find？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When they talked to consumers， they basically found most people like milk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They also felt milk was healthy。 Kids felt milk is cool and fun。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Teens felt milk makes you strong and beautiful， but yet when you looked at the
    data in terms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of what was happening to milk consumption， it was going down rapidly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a time when people felt good about the product， at a time when people felt
    it was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a cool product， yet when you looked at the actual consumption， it was going
    down， not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just slowly but quite a bit。 And milk producers were very concerned about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they started looking into what is the cause of the problem and what is the
    remedy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As they looked deeper， what they found was people wanted to drink milk， but
    often they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: didn't have milk at home。 They felt that based on these interviews and focus
    groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that if you could just convince， people to have milk at home， consumption will
    go up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is true not just for milk。 People have found this in other product
    categories also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， soft drink companies have found it in their studies that if you
    have more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cocola at home， you will drink more of it。 Same way， shampoo。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you have more shampoo left in the bottle， you will consume more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you look at the amount of shampoo people pour on their hand before they
    put it on their， head。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's very closely related to how much shampoo is left in the bottle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you have a new bottle of shampoo， you pour more on your hand。 When very
    little is left。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you pour less。 Of course， less is also just fine， especially for people who
    don't have that much here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but， still the consumption of shampoo is related to how much you have at home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Milk producers found the same thing that if people just had more milk at home，
    they would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: drink more。 And the idea was then how do you say it in a very creative and a
    memorable way so that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people would actually have milk at home。 Many decisions have to be made。 For
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they had to decide who should they talk to， what should they tell them in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: terms of how they should do， think or feel about milk。 What specifically did
    we want to achieve？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Was it about increasing consumption？ Was it about getting more people？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How are you going to say that in terms of your message？ What media are you going
    to use？ TV。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: digital， billboards？ How much money are you going to spend？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then how do you measure whether it's going to be effective or not？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for each of these questions， these were the planned answers they had in their
    mind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is on which the communications campaign was based。 So their target
    audience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they said it's not about getting new people to drink milk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are enough people who drink milk already， but we want them to drink more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the target segment here was people who currently drink milk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Make sure you have enough milk at home。 That was the message content。 Why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because they believed that if they just had more milk at home， they would consume
    more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mission of the campaign was increasing milk consumption by one glass per
    week within， a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they came up with a campaign which we'll talk more about。 Media strategy
    was TV and print。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They had to decide on a budget。 And they had already put in place measurement
    and their mission which is we wanted to have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a certain level of recall in three months。 They came up with a campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of you may have seen these ads。 They are also available on YouTube。 You
    can go and see them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a lot of continuity in this campaign。 It's the same message repeated
    in many different ways in many different contexts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes they use celebrities。 We will talk about that in this module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And sometimes they just use regular people。 Again， we'll talk about that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But here is something important to keep in mind。 In any communication campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have to make these seven decisions。 What are these seven decisions？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is what we call as seven M's of a communications campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hope from your previous module to remember what are the four P's and what
    are the five， C's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we have the seven M's of designing a communication campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: M number one is who you're going to talk to。 M number two is what should we
    tell them？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: M number three， what do we want to achieve in terms of awareness， knowledge，
    interest， trial？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How should we say it？ That's how the creative strategy comes in。 The next part
    is media strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we reach them？ And then how much am I going to spend？ And then was it
    worth it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for the purpose of this session， we are not going to spend too much time
    on media strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and money。 We are going to spend more time on the other M's because I think
    those are the first few。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you need to get a good handle on。 Also when you open a typical textbook
    and marketing and you go to the chapter on designing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a communications campaign， what you will find is that it has only five M's in
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That doesn't mean that the book is not good enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think the book is trying to send you a signal that the first two M's， who's
    your target。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: segment and what is your key message or your value proposition is a decision
    that you should。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make well before you get to designing a communication campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reflect back on what Professor Kahn said in our session about positioning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the three key components of a positioning statement？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Who's your target segment and what are your points of difference？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's exactly where markets and message content comes from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This should have been decided well before you get to designing a communications
    campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/98743e58d68fada728e06dac46b79b5d_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's start with the first key M which is solely within the purview of a
    communications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: campaign and that is mission。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
