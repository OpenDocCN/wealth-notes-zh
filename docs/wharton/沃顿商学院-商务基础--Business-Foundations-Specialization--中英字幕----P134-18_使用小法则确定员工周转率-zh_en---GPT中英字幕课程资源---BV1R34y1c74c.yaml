    the Flow Unit。

    pick a different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Flow Unit。 We will think of the flow of employees through the organization，
    starting when they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first get hired， to the point that they will leave the job。 Just like with inventory，
    we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can ask ourselves how long does the typical employees stay in our organization。
    This will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get us to the ten year of the employee， and it will also help us determine how
    many new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: employees we have to hire each year。 So let's take a look。 Here on the left
    of the slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I repeat the calculations we did in the last video。 So the， Flow Units are dollar
    bills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the inventory is the number of dollar bills in the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In little slaw connects all three， we can do the same thing for employees flowing
    through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the organization where new hires are the inflows， departures are the outflows，
    and you can see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here how long the organization holds an employee。 What is the average ten year
    of the employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when he or she leaves the company？ So the logic is really exactly the same。
    So we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: find the employee turnover as lost employees per year， the departures， divided
    by the average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: number of employees， that is employee turnover。 And then we can think about
    the average ten。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: year of an employee on the day of their departure。 So that's really their flow
    time。 Of birth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that on the day of departure， i。e。 when they leave， that is one over the employee
    turnover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And notice the distinction here， the average ten year of an employee is just
    half the average。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ten year of the day of their departure， right？ At any time some people are new
    to the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might be on the first day of the job， and some people will be on the last
    day of， the job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: holding everything else equal， the average employee is exactly in the middle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's look at a specific example。 The average employee has a ten year at cost
    score of nine， years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， that is the average ten year。 And I'm asking you what is the average
    ten。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: year when they leave cost score？ They're ten year on the departure， right？ And
    remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we said this is basically double the average employee ten year。 And so two times
    nine years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the ten year when they leave the organization。 This is going to be equal
    to 18 years。 That's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a long time that they stay at cost score， a really long time。 So when we look
    at the employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turnover， then that is just one over 18。 So when we then want to look at how
    many employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's cost score have to hire， and for the sake of argument， assume that the
    workforce。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: stays constant here。 So that's little slow， i equals r times t。 And so what
    do we know？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to have 160，000 employees in the organization。 So that's our inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So i equals r times the flow time， right？ And we set the flow time， that time
    is the ten。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: year when they have， when they leave the firm after 18 years， right？ And so
    we're solving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for r this time。 And so r is equal to 160，000 people divided by 18 years， which
    gives us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little less than 9，000 people that we have to hire each year。 Employee turnover
    is an。

- en: important concept。 Some of the big consulting firms have an average ten year
    on the day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of departure of a consultant of around four years。 That means their average
    ten year on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the job is about two years。 It also means that for every hundred consultants
    on their， payroll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have to hire 25 new consultants every year， not to grow， but just to say
    put。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As i mentioned before， little slow always holds。 It includes the case in which
    a firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is rapidly growing and thus adding employees。 In this case， however， you might
    have to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more careful in determining the average number of employees as this number is
    likely to vary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over time。 Similarly， not many employees might already have left the company。
    And so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the average ten year on the day of departure is something that you have to measure
    very， carefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Either way， the basic logic of little slow still applies even now over 50 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after it was first proven。 You can use it to compute flow time given inventory
    and flow， rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can compute inventory turns and inventory costs or you can look at the turnover，
    of employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the next video， we will practice these calculations。 See you then。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
