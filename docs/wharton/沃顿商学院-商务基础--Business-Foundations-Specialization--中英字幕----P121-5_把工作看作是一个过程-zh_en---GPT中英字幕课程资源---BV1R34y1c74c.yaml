- en: In this video， I want to tie up a couple of loose things related to process
    analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ba13e843e8c096d65b365180cc8f2d30_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I first want to explain how process analysis and the process flow diagram help
    us reconcile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two perspectives through an operation。 The perspective of the flow unit， which
    likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will be handled by multiple research as it's journeying through the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the perspective of a resource， which likely will see many flow units over
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I want to give you the opportunity to practice the definition we introduced
    so far。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with a little practice problem。 Okay， here we go。 First imagine you work in
    an auto plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're the person who puts in the seat into the car。 Really every minute
    or two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a new car arrives on the assembly line and you repeat your operation。 You put
    in that seat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You do this over and over and over again。 Similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might be working in the radiology department。 Every 15 minutes or so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an image of a buddy part comes in。 You diagnose， you read the image， you put
    together a report。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then the next patient comes。 This is a view of a resource in a process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's simply called it the resources perspective。 As a resource， you have
    a capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have a utilization， and you might even be the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ba13e843e8c096d65b365180cc8f2d30_3.png)'

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Diageoño is known as the father of the Toyota production system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and is really one of the most influential thinkers in operations management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He would famously draw a chalk circle on a piece of the factory floor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and his students would have to stand in this chalk circle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they will have to observe the process。 Ono would check in on them and ask
    them to report their observations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ba13e843e8c096d65b365180cc8f2d30_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If they are not seen the waste and the inefficiencies that all wanted them to
    see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they will just keep on standing in that chalk circle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hope you very much appreciate that in my course， all you have to do is watch
    some videos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rather than spending your day in a chalk circle。 Contrast the resources perspective
    with the floor units perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a patient， you very likely have experienced the floor unit perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you went through an episode of care， such as an radiology appointment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To show you the example of the floor units perspective and in order more of
    assembly process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take a look at the video from Tesla that I found on YouTube。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Really what you're doing is you're attaching yourself to the floor unit， and
    then you flow along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you flow through the process。 You see one resource after the other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and by making your journey through the assembly line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you start really in this case as a piece of metal， and then you go through the
    process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and step by step the floor goes on。 You spend your floor time and the amount
    of time it takes you to go through the process here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the resources and at the end of the process you complete the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you have turned into a wonderful car。 There you go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the beauty of process analysis is that it combines both the perspective
    of the floor unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the perspective of the resource， all in one diagram。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's a simplified process flow diagram from a Tesla plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can read that process flow diagram with the eyes on the floor units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and on floor time the journey through the plant， or you can take the perspective
    of a particular resource。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like the paint shop， and you just focus on that capacity。 Whatever perspective
    you're taking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you will have to deal with inventory。 Remember from before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inventory is a number of floor units in the system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inventory pass up whenever demand and supply don't match。 Since demand is moving
    quickly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or a supplier is simply slow to adjust， you either have too much demand or you
    have too much supply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now as a risk of creating some confusion， inventory in the car example can be
    a pile of cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ba13e843e8c096d65b365180cc8f2d30_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: waiting for demand， and historically for most car companies that has been the
    default。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most car companies carry about 60 to 80 days of inventory in their lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in my framework it can also be a number of customers waiting for a car。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tesla for example had hundreds of thousands of customers waiting for the Model
    3， I was one of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and later on they had hundreds of thousands of people waiting for the Cybertron。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we define the customer as a floor unit， the number of customers waiting for
    their cars is simply inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， I know it's a little bit confusing because it's different from accounting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not that operations is right and accounting is wrong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a different way of looking at the world including inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In making physical stuff you can have inventory reflecting waiting stuff， widgets，
    cars， iPhones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whatever you're producing， or you can have waiting customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you're dealing with service operations however， you can only have one scenario。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For all practical purposes it's impossible to produce a hard surgery into inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also cannot have an investment discussion with your clients before the client
    actually shows up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in a service operation inventory always really relates to waiting customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that we are at the end of a module， it's a good time to review what we
    have done so far in this module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We work through a ton of definitions from floor unit over processing times to
    capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the way to my favorite three， floor rate， flow time， and inventory。 More
    importantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want you to at this point be capable， competent and confident to do the following。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should be able to map out an operation as a process flow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: find the capacity of an individual resource， and then find the bottleneck in
    a process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should also be able to compute the flow rate as a minimum of demand and
    capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and find the utilization of a resource。 For that these three definitions and
    equations at the bottom of the slide will come in handy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as we are going to see in the first practice problem that we are about to tackle
    together in a couple of seconds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， for this module I've done enough of the talking。 It is your time to do
    some work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I want you to do is I'm going to show you a practice problem and I give
    you a time to wrestle with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You simply read the problem， stop the video， see if you can find the solutions
    to the questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you press play again to see me solve the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This practice problem here describes the patient flow in a dental practice in
    Philadelphia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See if you can answer the following questions。 Put me on pause now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a look at this together。 Let's do the process flow diagram first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We start out by drawing a little triangle。 That's inventory of patients who
    need to self-check in at the kiosk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From there we have a bunch of other steps， versus another triangle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where the patients are waiting for the receptionist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right now we have no clue where the bottleneck might be。 So let's put a buffer
    here just in case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then a box， another triangle just before the dental assistant。 I hope you get
    the basic idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last triangle before the dentist， then comes the dentist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I don't know what you do after seeing the dentist， but I typically go home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So no triangle of completed patients。 But if for whatever reason we want to
    have people still recovering from their pain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we could have another triangle or box as a recovery area。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the end of the process flow diagram。 Okay， next is what is the capacity
    of the dentist？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The dentist is a resource， and the capacity of the resource is M， the number
    of dentists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divided by the processing time。 So we have 10 dentists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and each of them takes 30 minutes to see one patient。 So just 10 divided by
    30。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that is expressed in patients per minute， one third of a patient per minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or if you want to translate this into hours， you multiply this by 60 minutes
    in an hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the minutes cancel out， and we add 20 patients per hour in terms of the capacity。
    All right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's the bottleneck in the process？ The bottleneck is the resource with the
    lowest capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we have to look at the minimum of these capacities。 The first capacity
    is one half。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one over two at the kiosk。 One resource M equals one divided by two minutes。
    And it's two over five。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we get three over 15。 And then finally， as we just computed， 10 over
    30 for the dentist。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the lowest one of those will point us to the location of the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is three over 15。 Right？ Three over 15 is one over five。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is expressed in patients per minute。 So this corresponds to 12 patients
    per hour as a bottleneck capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that means that's the capacity of the entire process。 Flow rate， remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the minimum of demand and capacity。 So minimum of demand and capacity here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning there are plenty of patients who want our service。 If demand is unlimited，
    of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unlimited is a really big number。 And then the minimum， thereby， is 12 patients
    per hour。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which was our process capacity。 Finally， what's the utilization at the resource
    of the receptionist？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember， in general， when we think about utilization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we think about the ratio between the flow rate， how much is the process producing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the capacity of how much could the process be computing， if it went all
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the utilization is flow rate divided by capacity。 And in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see that it's 12 patients per hour， which was our flow rate determined by
    the bottleneck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divided by the capacity of the receptionist， which is 2/5 patients per minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or 24 patients per hour。 That's the utilization of the receptionist。 It's 50%。
    By now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm sure you're getting comfortable with the idea of capacities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ba13e843e8c096d65b365180cc8f2d30_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: utilization， bottlenecks， and my three favorite measures， inventory， flow rate，
    and flow time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is really the foundation for any good process analysis。 In the next set
    of videos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will start building on this foundation。 We will add a number of diagnostic
    performance measures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and from there， we'll start thinking about the first set of operational improvements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See you in the next module。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
