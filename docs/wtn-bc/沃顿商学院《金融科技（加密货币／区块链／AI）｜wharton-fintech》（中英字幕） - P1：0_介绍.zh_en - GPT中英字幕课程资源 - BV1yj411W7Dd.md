 I'm also Academic Director of the Jacobs Levy Equity Management Center for Quantitative。

 Financial Research and the Academic Director of the Wharton Wealth Management Initiative。

 In today's lectures， we'll be looking at the broad notion of the FinTech market。 Its definition。

 its depth， its breadth both across time and in the cross-section of。

 countries in which we see FinTech evolving。 We'll also look at some of the specifics driven by research into the potential audiences。

 of FinTech。 Users， adoption rates， as well as some results from recent research on algorithms that trust。

 that goes behind adoption of algorithmic approaches， as well as some of the headwinds。

 and tailwinds to that adoption。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
